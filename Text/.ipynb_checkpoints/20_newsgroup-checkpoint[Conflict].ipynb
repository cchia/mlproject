wisdom can be name clling too unless you consider yourself deserveless unless you are referring to someone else you have in fact given me a name i did not ask for hence the term 'name calling' hasan writes so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom i replied if you insist on giving me namestitles i did not ask for you could at least spell them correctly sigh hasan gloats that was only to confuse you ha ha ha hey hellbent on retarding into childhood no when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on the ground of occupied territories no i am not neglecting that i'm merely asking you whether the existance of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right are you trying to retaliate and confuse me here no i really do try to spell correctly and i apologize if i did confuse you i will try not to repeat that to live a as you so eloquently put it human right we can get back to the question of which law should be used in the territories later also you have not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens in the wb revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation of the wb revoke the right of life for somemost its citizens basically revokes the right of for its military men clearly occupation is an undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate ok let me rephrase the question i have repeatedly asked you if the israelis have less human rights than the palestinians and if so why from your posting where you did not directly adress my question i inferred that you thought so together with the above statement i then assumed that the reason was the actions of the state of israel re your statement of occupation i'd like you to define the term so i don't have to repeat this 'drag the answer out of hasan' procedure more than neccesary secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment to protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing palestinean human rights i'm sorry but the above sentence does not make sense please rephrase it if a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions then tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all because not all states are like israel as oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant oh ok so how about the human rights of the syrians iraqis and others does the name of hama sound familiar or how about the kurds in iraq and turkey how about the same in sweden ok maybe a bit farfetched the russians in the baltic states or the moslem in the old ussr and yugoslavia do the serbs have any human rights remainaing according to you and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem the question is not which system would solve the me problem why because any system can solve it the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine i asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for all people involved i assumed that was obvious but i won't repeat that mistake now that i have straightened that out i'm eagerly awaiting your reply so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph no i'm agreeing that to just kick all the palestinians out of israel proper would probably lead to disaster for both parties if that's what you refer to as the 'israeli solution' then so be it joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization said it best when writing in his diary in NUM between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country the only solution is a palestine at least western palestine west of the jordan river without arabs and there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be left only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the millions of our own brethren there is no other way out davar NUM september NUM courtesy of marc afifi just a question if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas charter that's the english translations if you have other information i'd be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to a private paper even older i'm not going to get into the question if he wrote the above but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics guess what those are not the people that will make any lasting peace in the region more deleted stuff exactly you are right i guess that the problem is that the israeli govermentis full with men like joseph weitz oh have you met with them personally to read their diaries fascinating what do you do for a living we and our either refers to zionists or jews i donot know which well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem i think that is fair enough no that is not an answer since i asked for a system that could solve the problem you said any could be used then you provided a contradiction above you wrote that you understood what i meant underlined by any system can be used to solve the conflict but not any system would resolve it justly an unjust solution would be a nonsolution per definition no you said the following for all a it holds that a have property b there exists an a such that property b does not hold thus either or both statements must be false guess where that takes your logic to nevernever land you are proving yourself as a first you understood what i meant but then you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic too bad for you the master of wisdom i was merely pointing out a not so small flaw in your reasoning since you claim to be logical i felt it best to point this out before you started using your statements to prove a point or so am i then to assume you are not logical the greatest problem of zionism is arab children rabbi shoham oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are a real bummer when i try giving your posts any credit why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in if you were a zionists if you believe in zionist codes and acts well i feel sorry for you because the same rabbi shoham had said yes zionism is racism if you feel ashamed and bothered by the zionist codes then drop zionism if you are not zionist why are you bothered then you should join me in condemning these racist zionist codes and acts any quote can be misused especially when used to stereotype all individuals by a statement of an individual if you use the same methods that you credit 'zionists' with then where does that place you oh by the way i'd advice you not to assume anything about my 'loyalties' i will and am condemning acts i find vile and inhuman but i'll try as long as i can not to assume those acts are by a whole people by zionist above do you mean the state of israel the government of israel the leaders of israel political andor religious

bm gimme a break capital letters or not the above is pure nonsense it bm seems to me that short sighted armenians are escalating the hostilities henrik\\tagain armenians in karabakh are simply defending themselves what do henrik\\twant them to do lay down their arms and let azeris walk all over them news reports i've seen say otherwise both location and motives wise caps don't change facts bm while hoping that turkey will stay out stop and think for a moment bm will you armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict it bm is a part of it henrik armenians knew from the begining that turks were fully engaged henrik training azeris militarily to fight against karabakhiarmenians so should i at this point break into caps and start talking about defense etc i don't know how 'fully engaged' turkey iswas though henrik the karabakhiarmenians who have lived in their homeland for NUM henrik years cut off from armenia and given to azeris by stalin are the henrik ones directly involved in the conflict they are defending henrik themselves against azeri aggression bm huh you didn't expect azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them bm within their borders henrik well history is sad remember those are relocated azeris into henrik the armenian land of karabakh by the stalin regime so i hear this justifies bloodshed n years after the fact henrik at last i hope that the us insists that turkey stay out of the henrik karabakh crisis so that the repeat of the cyprus invasion will never henrik occur again bm you're not playing with a full deck are you where would turkey invade henrik it is not up to me to speculate but i am sure turkey would have stepped henrik into armenia if she could why would turkey do that do you not realize that this is a local clash that turkey never wished to see happen turkey has other plans for region like economic revival cooperation etc good stuff in other words i'd be happy to bicker with armenians over trade barriers and such on usenet rather than 'who killed whom in what way' which i detest doing and wouldn't do bm are you throwing the cyprus buzzword around with scg in the header bm in hopes that the greek netters will jump the gun henrik absolutely not i am merely trying to emphasize that in many henrik cases history repeats itself even if one buys into your implicit premise the sane thing to do would be to try not to provoke turkey as was done in '74 if there'd been a democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in athens at the time everybody would have stayed home with their families i have no wish to go into the cyprus quarrel but i suspect what i've said is not only accurate but also palatable to all parties involved bm yes indeed turkey has the military prowess to intervene what she wishes bm she had however is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring bm the parties to the negotiating table that's hard to do when armenians bm are attacking azeri towns henrik so let me understand in plain words what you are saying turkey henrik wants a peaceful end to this conflict not so what do you think we want war death and destruction henrik i will believe it when i see it no if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it henrik now as far as attacking what do you do when you see a gun pointing henrikto your head do you sit there and watch or defend yourseffat chance this kind of childish rhetoric doesn't help anthing henrik do you remember what azeris did to the armenians in baku all the henrik barberian acts especially against mothers and their children i mean henrik burning people alive now some azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff perpetrated by armenians one should rehash stuff like this often to keep the hatred alive right bm armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the bmfutility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that bm leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's bm going to cause incessant skirmishes henrik armenians in karabakh want peace and their own republic they are henrik not asking much they simply want to get back what was taken away henrik from them and given to azeris by stalin well they obviously aren't getting anywhere with their current methods of asking not very peaceful i'd say bm think of NUM or NUM years down the line both of the newly independent bm countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe bm the other out these people will be neighbors would it not be better bm to keep the bad blood between them minimal henrik don't get me wrong i also want peaceful solution to the henrik conflict but until azeris realize that the armenians in henrik karabakh will defend themselves against aggresion i don't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans peace isn't what's happening right now furthermore what's happening right now isn't condusive to peace you can spend days and nights raving about how 'right' the armenian position is and i'm sure there'll be others who'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other side if entrenched positions lead to war and if people want peace than they should sit down and talk about a compromise armenia isn't strong enough to exercise the 'we think we're right and we have the bombs so we'll do whatever we want so there' style of foreign relations yes you can type stalin in caps and give one sided atrocity stories etc but for peace you need to be willing to talk to the other side you personally can choose not to do that of course this being just usenet the people in power shouldn't be so childish bm if you belong to the armenian diaspora keep in mind that what strikes bm your fancy on the map is costing the local armenians dearly in terms of bm their blood and future henrik again you are taking different turns armenia has no intension henrik to grab any land from azerbaijan the armenians in karabakh henrik are simply defending themselves until a solution is set azeri's would disagree with you on this and the maps i've seen support what they'd be saying it doesn't seem likely that a solution will be reached in this manner bm it's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize bm craziness to have your feelings about turks tickled the armenians bm in armenia and nk will be there with the same people you seem to hate bm as their neighbors for maybe NUM years more the sooner there's peace in bm the region the better it is for them and everyone else i'd push for bm compromise if i were you instead of hitting the capslock and spreading bm inflammatory halftruths henrik it is not up to me to decide the peace initiative i am absolutely henrik for it it didn't look it when i read your posting it would seem to me that if you can spew misinformation about a boogeyman you can also talk about how one might avoid the nastiness fair henrik but in the meantime if you do not take care of yourself henrik you will be wiped out such as the case in the era of NUM of henrik the armenian massacres you don't realize i can say the same thing about 'the turkish massacres' yes boys and girls let's always talk about how bad and nasty things were let's do that so we're overwhelmed by anger and let's do that so our kids will also be hateful sounds crazy doesn't it don't do it then bm\",\n",

comes up to the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one not checking passports just going by the way people look we get off the bus but are not taken for armenians we set out in the direction of home at first we were going to go into an old building where we knew there'd be a place to hide but the whole road was packed with groups of people all the way from block NUM to the 8th microdistrict these groups were emptying people's pockets and checking passports people who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well then we decided to go home instead near the 12story highrises i saw burning cars and a great many people standing around the driveways yelling death to the armenians was written on the cars when we came into the courtyardwe live in an lshaped buildingit was still quiet we went on upstairs but didn't turn on any lights we tried to call baku to warn our relatives who were due to arrive on wednesday not to come then there was a knock at the door it was our neighbors who advised us to come down to stay at their place we went down to their place and they led us to the basement they live on the first floor and have a basement which you enter across the balcony we sat in the basement while an armenian woman was beatenshe ran away naked our neighbors' daughter said that that's right that's what the armenians deserve because in stepanakert allegedly people were being killed NUM girls from agdam had been raped we didn't stay very long in the basement we tried to support one another as best we could looking out the small window with the iron grating papa watched and said things now and then he said that there was a fire near building NUM probably a car on fire then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that they be shown the apartments where armenians lived the neighbors said that there weren't any armenians here and the group set out for the other wing of the building they appeared from the NUM side of the building where i later found out a woman had been murdered the woman who ran away naked died yuri avakian was killed too when the crowd left the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go home we went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light we started to gather up our things in order to leave sumgait for a while we tried to call a relative who lived in sumgait but there was no answer we decided she had already left we sat at home the phone rang and the caller asked to speak with my father i called him to the phone it was jeykhun mamedov from my father's work brigade he said he was disgusted by what was happening in our town he asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get out of the city to be quite honest papa didn't want to give him our address but my mother got on the phone and told him some NUM minutes after the call a crowd ran into our entryway bursting into the building they broke down the door and came into the apartment they came straight to our apartment they knew exactly where the armenians were they came into our place we tried to resist but there was nothing we could do one of them took my parents' passports and began to read them he read the surname danielian turned the page read armenian and that alone was enough to doom us he said that we should be moved quickly out into the courtyard where they would have done with us another standing next to him pushed some of the keys on the piano and said your death has tolled they had knives and steel truncheons i had a knife in my hand unfortunately i didn't use it i just knew that if i didn't give up the knife things would be much worse they struck my parents and said that i should put the knife on the piano then one of them commanded that we be taken outside one person was giving orders when we were taken outdoors i went in the middle and my mother was behind me someone started to push her so she'd walk faster i let her go ahead of me and fell in behind her when he tried to push me i hit him and at that moment they began beating my parents i realized that resistance was completely useless we are taken out into the courtyard and the neighbors are standing on their balconies to see what will happen next the crowd surrounds us at first they strike me and i'm knocked out when i come to they beat me again i lose consciousness often i don't see or hear my parents since i was the first one hit and was out cold when i come to i try to pick them up they are lying next to me the crowd is gone the only people around are watching from their balconies that's it i try to pick them up but can't my left arm is broken i start toward the drive wanting to tell the neighbors to call an ambulance the bodies of my parents are still warm we were attacked at around NUM o'clock i regain consciousness at about NUM and try to make it up the stairs home when i knock at the neighbors' door they push me back and tell me to go away i go up to the third floor our neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance she sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment i often look out the window to see if the ambulance has arrived but i can't see very far as a result of the blows and it seems that my parents have already been taken away then i calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken away and everything will be ok but they were still there later at NUM in the morning as i found out the ambulance picked them up but they were already dead if they received attention on time it is possible they would still be alive later around NUM o'clock on the 29th policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with some assistants they call an ambulance and NUM minutes later it arrives and i am taken to the sumgait emergency hospital there they stitch the wounds on my head and rebind my arm at NUM o'clock i and the other armenians who are in the hospital are sent by ambulance to baku in my ward at the sumgait hospital there were five people all of them armenians the hospital was nearly overflowing with armenians the only azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events before the 27th then i was in the semashko hospital in baku i was there NUM days when i was released on the 40th day i found out that my parents were dead

in NUM my mother born in NUM was seda osipovna danielian papa worked at pmk20 the leader of the roofing brigade mamma was a compressor operator they were also beaten on the head the coroner's report stated that their heads were smashed open and bled profusely at the confrontation i met jeykhun mamedov who had called as it turned out later he had been the one who tipped the crowd off he had called specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address and dispatch the group he knew the phone number but didn't know the address before the events i had never seen him but had often spoken with him on the phone when he would ask to speak with my father i knew him by name he denies that i was the one who answered the phone saying that my father answered it he denies that he called from a public phone saying that he called from home which also isn't true i heard noise and the sounds of automobiles as i later found out earlier he had been convicted but had never served any timehe had received a suspended sentence he was about NUM years old i don't know if he has since confessed or not i am sure that he was the one who tipped the crowd off onehundred percent sure my parents were from karabagh father was from the village of badar and was two years old when his family moved to baku where his elder brothers were to go to school he was a student at the naval school but never graduated he went off to work on the virgin lands one of the gigantic agricultural projects instituted under khrushchev when he returned he lived in baku and later moved to sumgait helping with the town's construction mamma was from the village of dagdagan also from karabagh she worked in sumgait first in a bookstore and later on a construction site my sister is older than i she lives with her husband here in karabagh i always loved my parents that was why i went on to 9th grade because it was their dream that i would continue my studies i finished 8th grade and wanted to enter the baku nautical school and after that the military school but later i changed my mind or rather my parents got me to recon sider saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join the

here six policemen there and in handwriting of a mosque attendant the names of NUM corpses brought to be washed in just one day the most heartbreaking account from NUM witnesses interviewed so far

friends i could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route constructing equations or sets of equations but we were supposed to avoid using algebraic analysis at all costs by the way it's a fact that is well known and oft repeated that as a rule neither high school graduates nor students at teaching colleges nor teachers beginning their careers nor i must add scientific researchers can solve arithmetic problems it seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifthgrade teachers now i'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the bookbag

kingsley's book and saw the history of herodotus good lord next he'll be reading thucydides thought the royal astronomer fred hoyle the black cloud the book i'm talking about isn't very big but its NUM problems constitute NUM elegant miniatures from seventhcentury armenia naive and wise at the same time rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period these problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of armenian architecture the church on the island of akhtamar in lake van in what is now turkey they are as inseparable from the image of armenia as the elegant letters of the armenian alphabet invented by mesrop mashtots or the songs of komitas or the paintings of saryan an edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a bibliographic rarity it was published under the title problems and solutions of vardapet NUM anania of shirak armenian mathematician of the seventh century translated and published by i a orbeli petrograd NUM the abundance of close observations and wideranging information about the way of life and customs of that remote epoch when anania of shirak lived and worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book for many years the book was known only to researchers in the humanitiesspecialists in armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just anyone see it even now after research by k p patkanov the learned monk father kaloust ji orbeli a abramyan v k chaloyan and others has brought the works of anania of shirak to light in scholarly circles the general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable problem book vardapet anania of shirak once fell in love with the art of calculation i thought that no philosophical notion can be constructed without number considering it the mother of all wisdom anania of shirak among ancient armenian thinkers vardapet anania of shirak stands out because of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his work some of his works have been preserved in addition to the problems and solutions the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation of scholars on weights and measures cosmography and calendrical theory and armenian geography of the seventh century ad the authorship of the last work was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient armenia movses of khoren in his autobiography anania of shirak has this to say about himself i anania of shirak having studied all the science of our armenian land and having learned the holy scripture intimately in the expression of the psalmist every day i illuminated the eyes of my mind feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation i came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy the mother of all sciences without number i could find in armenia neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the sciences i therefore went to greece and met in theodosiople a man named iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works he told me that in forth armenia NUM there lived a famous mathematician christosatur i went this person and spent six months with him but soon i noticed that christosatur was a master not of all science but only of certain fragmentary facts i then went to constantinople where i met acquaintances who told me why did you go so far when much closer to us in trebizon on the coast of pontus NUM lives the byzantine vardapet tyukhik he is full of wisdom is known to kings and knows armenian literature i asked them how they knew this they answered we saw ourselves that many people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of constantinople philagrus traveled with us bringing many young persons to become pupils of tyukhik when i heard this i expressed my gratitude to god who had quenched the thirst of his slave i went to tyukhik at the monastery of st eugene and explained why i had come he received me graciously and said i praise our lord that he sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of st gregory i am glad that all your country will learn from me i myself lived in armenia for many years as a youth ignorance reigned there vardapet tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with me the lord bestowed upon me his blessing i completely assimilated the science of number and with such success that my fellow students at the king's court began to envy me i spent eight years with tyukhik and studied many books that had not been translated into our language for the vardapet had an innumerable collection of books secret and explicit ecclesiastical and pagan books on art history and medicine books of chronologies why enumerate them by title in a word there is no book that tyukhik did not have and he had such a gift from the holy spirit for translating that when he sat down to translate something from the greek into armenian he did not struggle as other translators did and the translation read as if the work were written in that language originally tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had learned the armenian language when i was young he said i lived in trebizon at the court of the military chief ioannus patricus and for a long time up to the accession of mauritius to the throne i served as a military man in armenia and learned your language and literature during one attack by persian troops on the greeks i was wounded and escaped to antioch i lost all my possessions praying to the lord to heal my wounds i made a promise if you prolong my life i shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to collecting treasures of knowledge and the lord heard my prayers after i recovered i went to jerusalem and from there to alexandria and rome upon returning to constantinople i met a famous philosopher from athens and studied with him for many years after that i returned to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people after some years that philosopher died not finding a replacement for him the king and his courtiers sent for tyukhik and invited him to assume the teacher's position tyukhik citing the promise he made to god not to move far from the city turned down the offer but because of his wide leaning people came streaming from all countries to study with him and i the most insignificant of all armenians having learned from him this powerful science desired by kings brought it to our country supported by no one obligated only to my own industry god's help and the prayers of the blessed educator and no one thanked me for my efforts problems and solutions a half and one sixth and one nineninth of all the books were printed on verge' one fifth and one twohundredeightyfifthon rag paper one fortyfifth and one eighthundredfiftyfifthon vellum and fortyfive inscribed copieson dutch paper and so find how many copies were printed in all imitation of anania of shirak a latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli books have their own fate the fate of problems and solutions by anania of shirak is quite amazing the manuscripts of anania's book were preserved only because according to armenian historians in ancient and medieval armenia manuscripts were guarded from invaders like weapons and cherished like one's own children biding their time the manuscripts lay in the matenadaran a renowned depository of ancient manuscripts now the mesrop mashtots institute of ancient manuscripts and its hour finally arrived in NUM the learned monk father kaloust used two manuscripts to publish the problem book supplementing it with an introduction and commentary in NUM the book was translated into russian edited annotated and typeset by iosef orbeli a prominent scholar and later a member of the academy of sciences of the ussr in the translator's words the problems of anania are amusing full of life and simple orbeli goes on to say the subjects of the problems are generally taken from everyday life the scene is predominantly his homeland shirak and the surrounding countryside and the dramatis personae if they are named are the local princesthe kamsarakans including nersekh who was a contemporary of anania like other ancient authors anania of shirak used only aliquots that is fractions with a numerator of NUM when it is necessary to write fractions with numerators other than NUM one has to represent it as a sum of aliquots see the epigraph above like any true work of art the problems of anania suffer terribly in the retelling you have to read the originals albeit in translation in their full glory so let's open anania's problem booka gift from across the ages problems NUM and NUM relate to the armenian uprising against the persians in ad NUM problem NUM my father told me the following story during the famous wars between the armenians and the persians prince zaurak kamsarakan performed extraordinary heroic deeds three times in a single month he attacked the persian troops the first time he struck down half of the persian army the second time pursuing the persians he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers the third time he destroyed one eleventh of the persian army the persians who were still alive numbering two hundred eighty fled to nakhichevan and so from this remainder find how many persian soldiers there were before the massacre problem NUM during the famous armenian uprising against the persians when zaurak kamsarakan killed suren one of the armenian azats4 sent an envoy to the persian king to report the baleful news the envoy covered fifty miles in a day fifteen days later when he learned of this zaurak kamsarakan sent riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back the riders covered eighty miles in a day and so find how many days it took them to catch the envoy problem NUM mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal in the russian translation they are all called dishes but in the original armenian according to orbeli's note the dishes in the first and second instances are called mesur and in the third instance scutel scutel is a common armenian word but mesur had not been encountered in armenian literature before anania's problems and solutions problem NUM there was a tray in my house i melted it down and made other vessels from the metal from one third i made a mesur from one fourth another mesur from one fifth two goblets from one sixth two scutels and from two hundred ten drams i made a bowl and now find the weight of the tray several of the problems reflect the richness of the caucasian fauna in anania's time for instance problem NUM problem NUM once i was in marmet the capital of the kamsarakans strolling along the bank of the river akhuryan i saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast we caught a half and a quarter of the school and all the fishes that slipped out of the net ended up in a creel when i looked in the creel i found fortyfive fishes and now find how many fishes here were in all the temptation is great to present all NUM problems but i'll restrain myself and offer you just one more problem NUM provides some interesting information about the wild animals that inhabited armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no mention of them even in zoological reference books the wild donkey according to the generally accepted view never roamed the armenian lands yet anania of shirak offers evidence to the contrary problem NUM the hunting preserve of nersekh kamsarakan ter5 of shirak and asharunik was at the base of the mountain called artin one night great herds of wild donkey entered the preserve the hunters could not cope with the donkeys and running to the village of talin told nersekh about them when he arrived with his brothers and azats and entered the preserve they began killing the wild beasts half of the animals were caught in traps one fourth were killed by arrows the young which constituted one twelfth of all the animals were caught alive and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears and so find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre set in type by me iosef orbeli his biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a bibliography k uzbashyan academician iosef abgarovich orbeli anyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy 1n of the small printingn is the solution to the epigraph in the previous section of the russian translation of anania of shirak's problems and solutions a thin book with yellowed pages has probably noticed the variety of the fonts the elegance of the borders and the high quality of the design printing and binding such great attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for a degree in bookmaking and this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it an advertisement at the end of the book reads this book was typeset in december NUM at the printing offices of the russian academy of sciences by me iosef orbeli the text was also proofread laid out and decorated with borders by me various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project to the end the final pages of the book were typeset by m strolman typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned orientalist iosef orbeli who later became the director of the hermitage museum in leningrad he was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith orbeli had already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house typis academiae founded in NUM and known all over the scientific world for its rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters in preparing to publish the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of armenian churches orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve the unique signs and ligatures this complicated work was done by m g strolman unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the blockade of leningrad in world war ii when orbeli came to the printing offices of the academy of sciences times were hard the only way to publish the newly translated problems of anania was for orbeli to learn typesetting he had always been attracted to the printer's craft in NUM orbeli became the director of printing at the academy of sciences even after he retired he remained a tireless champion of russian academic typography back to earth this book by definition does not exhaust all the most important works in this domain the editor hopes that those who are guilty of this incompleteness will read these lines and stung by shame will work up if not a collection like this at least a monograph v bonchbruyevich introduction to the russian translation of solidbody symmetry by r knox and a gold let's imagine a time when space flight is an everyday thing and high schoolers will spend their breaks as astronautsin training in the perelman crater on the far side of the moon maybe one of the space travelers will take this very copy of quantum and another looking over her shoulder will read this article and say to himself this anania from shirak seems like a pretty interesting guy when i get home i'll try to find his problems good luck my young friend anania is sure to entertain you perhaps by then there will be more than n copies of his timeless problems and solutions and we can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by iosef orbeli NUM vardapet or vartabed

on and on and on now wait there is more mark alan epstein 'the ottoman jewish communities and their role in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries' klaus schwarz werlag freiburg NUM page NUM during the fifteenth century when the ottomans were struggling to reestablish themselves in the balkans there was considerable turmoil among the jewish communities in central and western europe even if the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the fourteenth are minimized it is easy to understand the attraction which ottoman life particularly when compared to life in europe held for the jews there is no way to tell how many jews left christendom for the realm of the rising muslim ottomans but with each account of persecution in or expulsion from christian countries it is recorded that some jews fled to ottoman territory the regularity of these reports suggests that the ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that there was a regular trickle of jewish families moving southward and eastward from western and central europe it is evident that the effects of plague late crusades and the general intolerance and persecution of jews in christian europe resulted in the redirection of the whole focus of jewish life which for more than two centuries was to be oriented toward muslim east page NUM in the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official in the edirne jewish community was rabbi yitzhak sarfati the ashkenazi chief rabbi of the city he was the most important rabbi in the city and the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation of the edirne jewry in the fifteenth century sarfati himself was from christian europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two recent arrivals from there who upon seeing the prosperity and freedom of the ottoman jews prevailed upon him to write their european coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate this remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant conditions in the ottoman domains but described as well the ease of travel to palestine and the holy places an attraction to those who would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there page NUM the impression gained from the hebrew sources is that the jews were firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them and the ottomans especially in comparison to relations with the christians of europe confirmation of the commonality of interests between muslims and jews is also indicated by the fact that european christians perceived the jews as allies of islam and were well aware of muslimjewish cooperation certainly the activity of important jewish financiers and politicians representing the ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed european sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers in addition it appears that christian pirates plundered ''turks and jews'' their sworn enemies and that europeans considered the jews to be agents who regularly reported to the ottomans there are wellknown examples of overt jewish support for the ottomans in the struggle against european powers the two best known instances of jewish support for the campaigning ottomans are the frequently cited instances of the jewish contributions to the conquests of buda in the early sixteenth century and of rhodes we also have reports of sympathy for the ottomans during the siege of chios an unpublished ottoman document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some greek towns page NUM it is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally accepted fact that the interests of jews and muslims coincided frequently and all parties involved jews muslims and christians were aware of the situation page NUM it seems that the relations between greeks and jews were not particularly cordial the two groups had little in common few common interests and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition which could serve as the basis for cooperation rather than enmity if there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it was that between muslims and jews neither of whom had much in common with the orthodox page NUM the general impression of muslimjewish relations in the ottoman context during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of interests from the earliest times the ottomans seem to have welcomed jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element the jewish response to this tolerance was a steady flow of jews from christian countries to ottoman domains page NUM from the period before NUM we have only a few indications that the ottomanjewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would characterize it for years afterward but the liberality of the ottomans in contrast to the intolerance of the byzantines and the protection and the security which the ottomans offered in comparison to conditions elsewhere leave little doupt that even then both the ottomans and the jews recognized their mutual interests page NUM it is impossible to say how fundamental the jews were in the success of the ottomans in rebuilding istanbul or in ottoman mercantile success in the sixteenth century that they played an important role in both cannot be doupted it is also unclear whether they were important enough to say that the ottomans would not have experienced their great success without the jews and that no other group could have been found to serve the ottomans as well as did the jews it is however unmistakably clear that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable partnership between jews and the nonjewish society in which they lived we must conclude that the ottomans could probably not achieved their success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the jews did certainly for the jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the ottoman empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home a version of rabbi sarfati's tzarfati letter is given by profshaw page NUM your cries and sobs reached us we have been told of all the troubles and persecutions which you have to suffer in the german landsi hear the lamentation of my brethrenthe barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly oppresses the faithful children of the chosen peoplethe priests and prelates of rome have risen they wish to root

are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets apart from mordechai vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors there was one other espionage case the nutty professor at the nes ziona biological institute who was a kgb mole who was tried in camera i wouldn't exactly call it a state secret the trial was simply tried behind closed doors i hate to disappoint you but the united states has tried a number of espionage cases in camera at issue was not a trial behind closed doors but arrest trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy this was appraently attempted in the case of vanunu and failed it has happened before and there is reason to believe it still goes on read this from ma'ariv february NUM possibly NUM NUM publication ban the state of israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public by baruch me'iri all those involved in this matter politely refused my request one way or another look the subject is too delicate if i comment on it i will be implicitly admitting that it is true if i mention a specific case even hint at it i might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published the state of israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public more precisely a court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest and later on their imprisonment in israel of NUM citizens are imprisoned without us the citizens of this country knowing anything about it not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison for security offenses in complete secrecy in the distant past for example during the days of the lavon ya affair we heard about the third man being in prison but many years have passed since then and what existed then can today no longer be found even in south american countries or in the former communist countries but it appears that this is still possible in israel of NUM the chair of the knesset committee on law the constitution and justice mk david zucker sent a letter on this subject early this week to the prime minister the minister of justice and the cabinet legal advisor ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter during the past several years a number of israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses in some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment in those cases after being legally convicted the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner asserts mk zucker on the other hand zucker agrees in his letter that there is absolutely no question that it is possible and in some cases it is imperative that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials but even in such cases the court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public however one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest and on the name of a person sentenced to prison is justified and appropriate in the state of israel the principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison zucker thus decided to turn to the prime minister the minister of justice and the cabinet legal advisor and request that they consider the question the state of israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment the state of israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret wrote zucker the legal counsel of the civil rights union attorney mordechai shiffman said that we as the civil rights union do not know of any cases of security prisoners citizens of israel who are imprisoned and whose imprisonment cannot be made public this is a situation which if it actually exists is definitely unhealthy just like censorship is an unhealthy matter the union is aware says shiffman of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld i am speaking only of several days i know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney sometimes for the whole first month of arrest that is done because of the great secrecy the suspect himself his family his lawyer or even a journalist can challenge the publication ban in court but there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity the journalist knows nothing of the arrest and so almost everyone is happy attorney yossi arnon an official of the bar claims that given the laws as they exist in israel today a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible nothing is easier the court orders a publication ban and that's that someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it do you find this situation acceptable attorney arnon definitely not we live in a democratic country and such a state of affairs is impermissible i am well aware that publication can be damaging from the standpoint of security but total nonpublication silence is unacceptable consider the trial of mordechai vanunu at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to NUM years in prison the trial was held behind closed doors nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to it is somehow possible to understand though not to accept the reasons but as i have noted we at least are aware of his imprisonment why is the matter actually that serious can't we trust the discretion of the court attorney arnon the judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them the judges do not have the tools to investigate this gives the government enormous power power which they can misuse and what if there really is a security issue attorney arnon i am a man of the legal system not a security expert democracy stands in opposition to security i believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges without entering into detail we have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused in the case of the rachel heller murder a suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public attorney shiffman on the other hand believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment a healthy situation definitely not but i am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security a different opinion is expressed by attorney uri shtendal former advisor for arab affairs to prime ministers levi eshkol and golda meir clearly we are speaking of isolated special cases such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public no doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication nevertheless adds shtendal the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles i've mentioned the authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the prime minister or the security services but with the court which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt nevertheless attorney shtendal agrees as a rule clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances yigal arens uscisi tv made me do it arensisiedu\",\n",

have babies for us muslim babies let them bear azerbaijanis for the struggle against the armenians then they said those muslims can carry on our holy cause heroes they repeated it very often continued from part a the six of them left they left and i had an attack i realized that the dan ger was past and stopped controlling myself i relaxed for a moment and the physical pain immediately made itself felt my heart and kidneys hurt i had an awful kidney attack i rolled back and forth on top of those christmas ornaments howling and howling i didn't know where i was or how long this went on when we figured out the time later it turned out that i howled and was in pain for around an hour then all my strength was gone and i burst into tears i started feeling sorry for myself and so on and so forth then someone came into the room i think i hear someone calling my name i want to respond and restrain myself i think that i'm hallucinating i am silent and then it continues it seems that first a man's voice is calling me then a woman's later i found out that mamma had sent our neighbor the one whose apartment she was hiding in uncle sabir kasumov to our place telling him i know that they've killed lyuda go there and at least bring her corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse he went and returned empty handed but mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his apartment she sent him another time and then sent his wife and they were walking through the rooms looking for me but i didn't answer their calls there was no light they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps they started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock and at NUM i went down to the kasumovs' i went down the stairs myself i walked out of the apartment how long can you wait for your own death how long can you be cowardly afraid come what will i walked out and started knocking on the doors one after the next no one not on the fifth floor not on the fourth opened the door on the third floor on the landing of the stairway uncle sabir's son started to shout aunt roza don't cry lyuda's alive he knocked on his own door and out came aunt tanya igor and after them mamma aunt

over to one side her eye was all swollen and everything flowed together her lips her cheeks it was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole microdistrict that's how disfigured her face was i said fine mamma was afraid to go into the room because she went in and hugged karina and started to cry i went in as soon as i saw her my legs gave way i fell down near the bed hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying she opened the eye that was intact looked at me and said who is it but i could barely talk my whole face was so badly beaten i didn't say but rather muttered something tender something incomprehensible but tender my karochka my karina my little golden one she understood me then igor brought me some water i drank it down and moistened karina's lips she started to groan she was saying something to me but i couldn't understand it then i made out it hurts i hurt all over her hair was glued down with blood i stroked her forehead her head she had grit on her forehead and on her lips she was groaning again and i don't know how to help her she calls me over with her hand come closer i go to her she's saying something to me but i can't understand her

karina just lie there a little while then maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then and then she says maybe it'll be too late and i completely just broke down i couldn't control myself then i moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye i dipped a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips she says lyuda we're not saved yet we have to go somewhere else out of this damned house they want to kill us i know they'll find us here too we need to call urshan she repeated this to me for almost a whole hour until i understood her every word i

ourselves she says well ok if it's that serious and all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up and that i'm fearing for my life that in fact it's not all that bad ok fine fine she says if you're afraid ok as soon as urshan comes back i'll send him over we called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly under aunt tanya's on the second floor asya dallakian's apartment she wasn't home she was staying with her daughter in karabagh they destroyed everything there we realized that they still might come back we kept on trying to get through to aunt tanyaurshan's wife is named tanya too and finally we get through she says yes he's come home he's leaving for your place now he came of course he didn't know what was happening either because he brought two of his daughters with him he came over in his jeep with his two daughters like he was going on an outing he came and saw what shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened he has grown up daughters they're almost my age the three of us carried out karina tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf and went down to his car he took karina and me to the maternity home no first they took us to the poice precinct they had stretchers ready as soon as we got out of the car they put karina and me on stretchers and said that we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move we might have fractures from the stretcher i saw about NUM soldiers sitting and lying on the first floor bandaged on the concrete floor groaning this was around eleven o'clock at night we had left the house somewhere around NUM when i saw those soldiers i realized that a war was going on soldiers enemies everything just like a war they carried me into some office on the stretcher the emergency medical people from baku were there the medical attendant there was an older armenian urshan told him what they had done to karina because she's so proud she would never have told and this aging armenian his name was uncle arkady i think because someone said arkady get an injection ready he started to fill a syringe and turned around so as to give karina a shot but when he looked at her face he became ill and he was an old man in his sixties his hair was all grey and his moustache too he hugged karina and started to cry what have they done to you he was speaking armenian what have they done to you karina didn't say anything mamma came in then and she started to cry too the man tried to calm her i'll give you a shot mamma tells him i don't need any shot where is the government just what are they doing look what they've done to my children they're killing people and you're just sitting here some teacups were standing on the table in there you're sitting here drinking tea look what they've done to my daughters look what they've turned them into they gave her something to drink some heart medicine i think they gave karina an injection and the doctor said that she had to be taken to the maternity home immediately papa and urshan i think even though papa was in bad shape helped carry karina out when they put her on the stretcher none of the medics got near her i don't know maybe there weren't any orderlies then they came to me what's the matter with you their tone was so official that i wrapped myself tighter in the halflength coat i had a blanket on too an orange one aunt tanya's i said i'm fine uncle arkady came over and was soothing me and then told the doctor you leave let a woman examine her a woman came an azerbaijani i believe and said what's wrong with you i was wearing my sister lyuda's nightshirt the sister who at this time was in yerevan when she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would be easier to breast feed the baby i tore the night shirt some more and showed her i took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her there was a huge wound about the size of a hand on my back from the indian vase she said something to them and they gave me two shots she said that it should be dressed with something but that they'd do that in the hospital they put me on a stretcher too they started looking for people to carry me i raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up and this woman i don't know if she was a doctor or a nurse said lie still you mustn't move when i was lying back down i saw two policemen leading a man his profile seemed very familiar to me i shouted stop one of the policemen turned and says what do you want i say bring him to me i want to look at him they brought him over and i said that person was just in our apartment and he just raped me and my sister i recognize him note it down they said fine but didn't write it down and led him on i don't know where they were taking him then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were sitting they went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car up closer one of the soldiers started talking to me sister i don't remember the conversation exactly but he asked me were we lived and what they did to us i asked him where are you from he said that he was from ufa apparently they were the first that were brought in the ufa police later i learned that they suffered most of all he says ok you're armenians they didn't get along with you but i'm a russian he says what are they trying to kill me for oh i remembered something else when i went out onto the balcony with kuliyev for a hammer and nails i looked out the window and saw two azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten he was pressed against the fence and he covered his head with his arms they were beating him with his own club the way he cried mamma made my skin crawl i don't know what they did to him if he's still alive or not and something else before he attack on our house we saw sheets clothes and some dishes flying from the third or fourth floor of the neighboring building but i didn't think it was azerbaijanis attacking armenians i thought that something was on fire or they were throwing something they didn't need out or someone was fighting with someone it was only later when they were burning a passenger car in the yard when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the armenians that i realized that this was serious that it was antiarmenian they took karina and me to the sumgait maternity home mamma went to them too and said i've been beaten too help me but they just ignored her my father went to them and said in a guilty voice as though it was his fault that he'd been beaten and says my ribs hurt so much those creeps have probably broken my ribs please look at them the doctor says that's not my job urshan said fine i'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor i'll find you one i'll bring one and have him look at you and he drove them to his apartment marina and i stayed there they examined us i was more struck by what the doctor said than by what those azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us i wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us but i was very surprised that in a soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the hippocratic oath could talk to victims like that by happyor unhappy coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our karina and she having examined karina said no problem you got off pretty good not like they did in kafan when you armenians were killing and raping our women karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anythingshe would certainly have had something to say then they examined me the same story they put us in a separate ward no shots no medicinal powders no drugs absolutely none they didn't even give us tea all the women there soon found out that in ward such and such were armenians who had been raped and they started coming and peering through the keyhole the way people look at zoo animals karina didn't see this she was lying there and i kept her from seeing it they put ira b in our ward she had also been raped true she didn't have any serious bodily injuries but when she told me what had happened at their place i felt worse for them than i did for us because when they raped ira her daughter was in the room she was under the bed on which it happened and ira was holding her daughter's hand the one who was hiding under the bed when they were beating ira or taking her earrings off gold when she involuntarily let go of her daughter's hand her daughter took her hand again her daughter is in the fourth grade she's NUM years old i felt really awful when i heard that ira asked them not to harm her daughter she said do what you want with me just leave my daughter alone well they did what they wanted they threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way now i would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night it was simply bartholomew's night i say they did what they would love to do every day steal kill rape many are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children the beasts explained it like this this would be repeated in NUM to NUM years and those children would be grown and then as they put it we'll come take the pleasure out of their lives those children this was about the girls that would be young women in NUM years they were thinking about their tomorrow because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation just as there was no trial or investigation in NUM and that those girls could be of some use in NUM years this i heard from the investigators one of the victims testified to it that's how they described their own natures that they would still be bloodthirsty in NUM to NUM years and in NUM yearsthey themselves said that and this too everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our marina many people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much i don't know why their eyes were red maybe because they hadn't slept the night before maybe for some other reason i don't know but they hadn't been smoking and they weren't drunk i'm positive because someone who has smoked will stop at nothing he has the urge to do and they spoke in a cultured fashion with marina little sister don't be afraid we won't harm you don't look over there where i was you might be frightened you're a muslim a muslim woman shouldn't see such things so they were really quite sober so we came out of that story alive each every day we have lived since it all happened bears the mark of that day it wasn't even a day of those several hours father still can't look us in the eyes he still feels guilty for what happened to karina mother and me because of his nerves he's started talk ing to himself i've heard him argue with himself several times when he thought no one is listening listen he'll say what could i do what could i do alone how could i protect them i don't know where to find the words it's not that i'm happy but i am glad that he didn't see it all happen that's the only thing they spared us or maybe it happened by chance of course he knows it all but there's no way you could imagine every last detail of what happened and there were so many conversations karina and i spoke together in private and we talked with mamma too but father was never present at those conversations we spare him that if you can say that and when the investigator comes to the house we don't speak with father present on february NUM the next clay karina and i were discharged from the hospital first they released me but since martial law had been declared in the city the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier there were many people there armenian victims i met the tovmasian family there from them i learned that rafik and their uncle grant had died they were sure that both had died they were talking to me and raya rafik's wife and grant's daughter and her mother were both crying then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard there's a little oneroom house outside there a recreation and reading area they took us in there the women were afraid to go because they thought that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide the women were shouting they explained to them we want to hide you better because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct we went into the little house there were no chairs or tables in there we had children with us and they were hungry we even had infants who needed to have their diapers changed no one had anything with them it was just awful they kept us there for NUM hours from the window of the one room house you could see that there were azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the police precinct as though they were spying on us the police precinct is surrounded by a wall like a fence and it's electrified but if they were standing on the wall it means the electricity was shut off this brought great psychological pressure to bear on us particularly on those who hadn't just walked out of their apartments but who hadn't slept for NUM hours or NUM or those who had suffered physically and spiritually the ones who had lost family members for us it was another ordeal we were especially frightened when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared we couldn't see a single person not in the courtyard and not in the windows we thought that they must have already been hiding under the building that they must have some secret room down there people were panicking they started throwing themselves at one another that's the way it is on a sinking ship we heard those people mainly young people whistling and whopping on the walls we felt that the end was approaching i was completely terrified i had left karina in the hospital and didn't know where my parents were i was sort of calm about my parents i was thinking only about karina if heaven forbid they should attack the hospital they would immediately tell them that there was an armenian in there and something terrible would happen to karina again and she wouldn't be able to take it then soldiers with dogs appeared when they saw the dogs some of the people climbed down off the fence then they brought in about another NUM soldiers they all had machine guns in readiness their fingers on the triggers we calmed down a little they brought us chairs and brought the children some little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands and took the children to the toilet but we all sat there hungry but to be honest it would never have occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people do eat then closer to nightfall they brought a group of detained criminals they were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs one of the men came back from the courtyard and told us about it raya tovmasian it was like a different woman had been substituted earlier she had been crying wailing and calling out oh rafik but when she heard about this such a rage came over her she jumped up she had a coat on and she started to roll up her sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone and suddenly there were soldiers and dogs and lots of people she ran over to them the bandits were standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall she went up to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash him then on to a second and a third everyone was rooted to the spot not one of the soldiers moved no one went up to help or made her stop her from doing it and the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands muttering something she came back and sat down and something akin to a smile appeared on her face she became so quiet no tears no cries then that round was over and she went back to beat them again she was walking and cursing terribly take that and that they killed my husband the bastards the creeps and so on then she came back again and sat down she probably did this the whole night through well it wasn't really night no one slept she went five or six times and beat them and returned and she told the women what are you sitting there for they killed your husbands and children they raped and you're just sitting there you're sitting and talking as though nothing had happened aren't you armenians she appealed to everyone but no one got up i was just numb i didn't have the strength to beat anyone i could barely hold myself up all the more so since i had been standing for so many hoursi was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already after ten at night because there weren't enough chairs really it was the elderly and women with children who sat i was on my feet the whole time there was nothing to breathe the door was closed and the men were smoking the situation was deplorable at eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us local policemen azerbaijanis they said get up they've brought mattresses you can wash up and put the children to bed now the women didn't want to leave this place either the place had become like home it was safe there were soldiers with dogs if anyone went outside the soldiers would say oh it's our little family and things like that the soldiers felt this love and probably for the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders everyone spoke from the heart cried and hugged them and they with their loaded machine guns in their hands said grandmother you mustn't approach me i'm on guard our people would say oh that's all right they hugged them one woman even kissed one of the machine guns this was all terribly moving for me and the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs they took us up to the second floor and said you can undress and sleep in here don't be afraid the precinct is on guard and it's quiet in the city this was the 29th when the killing was going on in block 41a and in other places then we were told that all the armenians were being gathered at the sk club and at the city party committee they took us there on the way i asked them to stop at the maternity home i wanted to take karina with me i didn't know what was happening there they told me don't worry the maternity home is full of soldiers more than motherstobe so you can rest assured i say well i won't rest assured regardless because the staff in there is capable of anything when i arrived at the city party committee it turned out that karina had already been brought there they had seen fit to release her from the hospi tal deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care once we were in the city party committee we gave free reign to our tears we met acquaintances but everyone was somehow divided into two groups those who hadn't been injured who were clothed who had brought a pot of food with them and so on and those like me like raya who were wearing whatever had come their way there were even people who were all made up dolled up like they had come from a wedding there were people without shoes naked people hungry people those who were crying and those who had lost someone and of course the stories and the talk were flying oh i heard that they killed him what do you mean they killed him he stayed at work do you know what's happening at this and such a plant talk like that and then i met aleksandr mikhailovich gukasian the teacher i know him very well and respect him highly i've known him for a long time they had a small room well really it was more like a studyroom we spent a whole night talking in that study once on march NUM we heard that bagirov first secretary of the communist party of azerbaijan ssr had arrived everyone ran to see bagirov what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed from outside he arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask him things everyone was in a tremendous rage but he was protected by soldiers and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with the people apparently he had more important things to do several hours passed gukasian called me and says lyudochka find another two or three we're going to make up lists they asked for them upstairs lists of the dead those whose whereabouts are unknown and lists of people who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned i had about NUM people in my list when they called me and said lyuda your mamma has arrived she's looking for you she doesn't believe that you are alive and well and that you're here i gave the lists to someone and asked them to continue what i was doing and went off the list was imprecise of course it included grant adamian raya tovmasian's father who was alive but at the time they thought him dead there was engels grigorian's father and aunt cherkez and maria the list also included the name of my girlfriend and neighbor zhanna agabekian one of the guys said that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front of the kosmos movie theater we put her on the list too and cried but later it turned out that that was just a rumor that in fact an hour earlier she had somehow left sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for krasnovodsk where thank god she was alive and well i should also say that in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead NUM all the lists were taken to bagirov i don't remember how many dead were contained in the list but it's a fact that when gukasian came in a couple of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate i asked what's going on he said lyuda can you imagine what animals what scoundrels they are they say that they lost the list of the dead piotr demichev member of the politburo of the central committee of the communist party of the ussr has just arrived and we were supposed to submit the list to him so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter of the tragedy whether it was one or fifty they told him that the list had disappeared and they should ask everyone who hadn't left for the khimik boarding house all over again there were NUM people on our second list i think that the number NUM was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio because that's the list that demichev got i remember exactly that there were NUM people on the list i had even told aleksandr mikhailovich that that was only a half of those that were on the first list he said lyuda please try to remember at least one more but i couldn't remember anyone else but there were more than NUM dead of that i am certain the government and the procuracy don't count the people who died of fright like sick people and old people whose lives are threatened by any shock they weren't registered as victims of the sumgait tragedy and then there may be people we didn't know so many people left sumgait between march NUM and NUM most of them left for smaller towns in russia and especially to the northern caucasus to stavropol and the krasnodarsk territory we don't have any information on them i know that there are people who set out for parts around moscow in the periodical krestyanka woman farmer there was a call for people who know how to milk cows and for mechanics and drivers and i know a whole group of people went to help out also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering the city who were burned in their cars no one knows about them except the azerbaijanis who are hardly likely to say anything about it and there's more a great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list drawn up at the procuracy i know of three instances for sure and i of course don't know them all i'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to publicize what had happened that is they didn't take the matter to court they simply left but in so doing they didn't cease being victims one of them is the first cousin of my classmate kocharian she lived in microdistrict no NUM on the fifth floor i can't tell you the building number and i don't know her name then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives she lived in microdistrict NUM near the gift shop i don't know her name she lives on the same landing as the sumgait procurator they beat her father he was holding the door while his daughter hid but he couldn't hold the door forever and when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her braid like the azerbaijanis were saying it was a very cultured mob because they didn't kill anyone they only raped them and left and the third one i don't remember who the third one was anymore they transferred us on march NUM karina still wasn't herself yes we lived for days in the sk in the cultural facility and at the khimik they lived there and i lived at the city party committee because i couldn't stay with karina it was too difficult for me but i was at peace she had survived i could already walk but really it was honest words that held me up thanks to the social work i did there i managed to persevere aleksandr mikhailovich said if it weren't for the work i would go insane he and i put ourselves in gear and took everything upon ourselves someone had an infant and needed diapers and free food and we went to get them the first days we bought everything although we should have received it for free they were supposed to have been dispensed free of charge and they sold it to us then when we found out it was free we went to krayev at the time fortunately you could still drop by to see him like a neighbor all the more so since everything was still clearly visible on our faces krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue on march NUM they sent two investigators to see us andrei shirokov and vladimir fedorovich bibishev the way it worked out in our family they had considered only karina and me victims maybe because she and i wound up in the hospital mother and father are considered witnesses but not victims shirokov was involved with karina's case and bibishev with mine after i told him everything he and i planned to sit down with the identikit and record everyone i could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind we didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the conditions weren't there the investigative group worked slowly and did poor quality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working there weren't enough automobiles especially during the time when there was a curfew and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts and no still or video cameras i think that this was done on purpose we're not so poor that we can't supply our investigators with all that stuff it was done especially to draw out the investigation all the more so since the local authorities saw that the armenians were leaving at the speed of light never to return to sumgait and the armenians had a lot to say i came to an agreement with bibishev i told him myself don't you worry if it takes us a month or two months i'll be here i'm not afraid i looked death in the eyes five times in those two days i'll help you conduct the investigation he and i worked together a great deal and i used this to shelter karina i gave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to her so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her self she was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x rays she couldn't eat or drink for nine days she was nauseous i didn't eat and drank virtually nothing for five days then on the fifth day when we were in baku already the investigator told me how long can you go on like this well fine so you don't want to eat you don't love yourself you're not taking care of yourself but you gave your word that you would see this investigation through we need you then i started eating because in fact i was exhausted it wasn't enough that i kept seeing those faces in our apart ment in my mind every day i went to the investigative solitary confinement cells and prisons i don't know we were just everywhere probably in every prison in the city of baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of sumgait at that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary confinement thus far i have identified NUM of the people who were in our apartment mamma identified three and karina two the total is NUM marina didn't identify anyone she remembers the faces of two or three but they weren't among the photographs of those detained i told of the neighbor i recognized the one who went after the axe he still hasn't been detained he's still on the loose he's gone and it's not clear if he will be found or not i don't know his first or last name i know which building he lived in and i know his sisters' faces but he's not in the city the investigators informed me that even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will continue looking for him the NUM people i identified are largely bluecollar workers from various plants without education and of the very lowest level in every respect mostly their ages range from NUM to NUM years there was one who was NUM only one of them was a student he was attending the azerbaijan petroleum and chemical institute in sumgait his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga tor once thinking that i was an employee and not a victim she said in front of me i'll set you up a restaurant worth NUM rubles and give you NUM in cash simply for keeping him out of armenia that is to keep him from landing in a prison on armenian soil they're all terribly afraid of that because if the investigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even though we identified him they tell himin order to apply psychological pressurethey say fine don't confess just keep silent when you're in an armenian prison when they find out who you are they'll take care of you in short order that somehow gets to them many give in and start to talk the investigators and i were in our apartment and videotaped the entire pogrom of our apartment as an investigative experiment it was only then that i saw the way they had left our apartment even without knowing who was in our apartment you could guess they stole for example all the money and all the valuables but didn't take a single book they tore them up burned them poured water on them and hacked them with axes only the materials from the 27th congress of the communist party of the soviet union and james fenimore cooper's last of the mohigans oh yes lunch was ready we were boiling a chicken and there were lemons for tea on the table after they had been in our apartment both the chicken and the lemons were gone that's enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment people who don't even know anything about books they didn't take a single book but they did take worn clothing food and even the cheapest of the cheap wornout slippers of those whom i identified four were kafan azerbaijanis living in sumgait basically the group that went seeking revengelet's use their word for itwas joined by people seeking easy gain and thrillseekers i talked with one of them he had gray eyes and somehow against the backdrop of all that black i remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes besides taking part in the pogrom of our apartment he was also involved in the murder of tamara mekhtiyeva from building NUM she was an older armenian who had recently arrived from georgia she lived alone and did not have anyone in sumgait i don't know why she had a last name like that maybe she was married to an azerbaijani i had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice and know nothing about her i do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an axe murdering her wasn't enough for them they hacked her into pieces and threw them into the tub with water i remember another guy really well too he was also rather fairskinned you know all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark both their hair and their skin and in contrast with them in addition to the grey eyed one i remember this one fellow the one l took to be a lezgin i identified him as it turned out he was eduard robertovich grigorian born in the city of sumgait and he had been convicted twice one of our own how did i remember him the name rita was tattooed on his left or right hand i kept thinking is that rita or puma which it would be if you read the word as latin characters instead of cyrillic because the cyrillic t was the one that looks like a latin m when they led him in he sat with his hands behind his back this was at the confrontation he swore on every holy book tried to put in an armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion and told me that i was making a mistake and called me dear sister he said you're wrong how could i an armenian raise my hand against my own an armenian and so on he spoke so convincingly that even the investigator asked me lyuda are you sure it was he i told him i'll tell you one more identifying mark if i'm wrong i shall apologize and say i was mistaken the name rita is tattooed on his left or right hand he went rigid and became pale they told him put your hands on the table he put his hands on the table with the palms up i said now turn your hands over but he didn't turn his hands over now this infuriated me if he had from the very start acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it that they forced him or something else i would have treated him somewhat differently but he insolently stuck to his story no i did not do anything it wasn't me when they turned his hands over the name rita was in fact tattooed on his hand his face distorted and he whispered something wicked i immediately flew into a rage there was an ashtray on the table a really heavy one made out of granite or something very large and it had ashes and butts in it catching myself quite by surprise i hurled that ashtray at him but he ducked and the ashtray hit the wall and ashes and butts rained down on his head and back and he smiled when he smiled it provoked me further i don't know how but i jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or strangling him i no longer remember which when i jumped i caught the microphone cord the investigator was there tolya i no longer recall his last name and he says lyudochka it's a japanese microphone please and shut off all the equipment on the spot it was all being video taped they took him away i stayed and they talked to me a little to calm me down because we needed to go on working i only remember tolya telling me you're some actress what a performance i said tolya honestly beforehand they would always tell me lyuda more emotion you speak as calmly as if nothing had happened to you i say i don't have any more strength or emotion all my emotions are behind me now i no longer have the strength i don't have the strength to do anything and he says lyuda how were you able to do that and when i returned to normal drinking tea and watching the tape i said can i really have jumped over that table i never jumped that high in gym class so you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international of the NUM we identified there was an armenian a russian vadim vorobyev who beat mamma and NUM azerbaijanis at the second meeting with grigorian when he had completely confessed his guilt he told of how on february NUM the azerbaijanis had come knocking among them were guysif you can call them guyshe knew from prison they said tomorrow we're going after the armenians meet us at the bus station at three o'clock he said no i'm not coming they told him if you don't come we'll kill you he said alright i'll come and he went they also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict kamo pogosian he had also been in prison i think that together they had either stolen a motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed they called him out of his apartment and told him the same thing tomorrow we're going to get the armenians be there he said no they pulled a knife on him he said i'm not going all the same and in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed him several times in the stomach he was taken to the hospital i know he was in the hospital in baku in the republic hospital if we had known about that we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th i'll return to grigorian what he did in our apartment i remember that he beat me along with all the rest he spoke azerbaijani extremely well but he was very fairskinned maybe that led me to think that they had it out for him too but later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning of shagen sargisian i don't know if he participated in the rapes in our apartment i didn't see i don't remember but the people who were in our apartment who didn't yet know that he was an armenian said that he did i don't know if he confessed or not and i myself don't recall because i blacked out very often but i think that he didn't participate in the rape of karina because he was in the apartment the whole time when they carried her into the courtyard he remained in the apartment at one point i was talking with an acquaintance about edik grigorian from her i learned that his wife was a dressmaker his mother is russian he doesn't have a father and that he's been convicted twice well this will be his third and i hope last sentence he beat his wife she was eternally coming to work with bruises his wife was an armenian by the name of rita the others who were detained well they're little beasts you really can't call them beasts they're just little beasts they were robots carrying out someone else's will because at the investigation they all said i don't understand how i could have done that i was out of my head but we know that they were won around to it and prepared for it that's why they did it in the name of allah in the name of the koran in the name of propagating islam that's holy to themthat's why they did everything they were commanded to do because i saw they didn't have minds of their own i'm not talking about their level of cultural sophistication or any higher values no education they work have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly they crowd them in like at the temporary housing and apparently they were promised that if they slaughtered the armenians they would receive apartments so off they went many of them explained their participation saying they promised us apartments among them was one who genuinely repented i am sure that he repented from the heart and that he just despised himself after the incident he worked at a children's home an azerbaijani he has two children and his wife works at the children's home too everything that they acquired everything that they have they earned by their own labor and wasn't inherited from parents or grandparents and he said i didn't need anything i just don't know how i ended up in that it was like some hand was guiding me i had no will of my own i had no strength no masculine dignity nothing and the whole time i kept repeating now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife right before your own eyes he sat there and just wailed but that leader in the eskimo dogskin coat was not detained he performed a marvelous disappearing act but i think that they'll get onto him they just have to work a little because that vadim that boy according to his grandfather is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do how to cover his tracks he was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he knew and those he didn't either and other things as well and changed himself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him but he was detained that one in the eskimo dogskin coat was at the gambarians' after aleksandr gambarian was murdered he came in and said let's go enough you've spilled enough blood here maybe karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was that they were hoping to take her home with them i heard this from aunt tanya and her sons the kasumovs who were in the courtyard near the entryway they liked her very much and they had decided to take her to home with them when karina came to at one pointshe doesn't remember this yet this the neighbors old meand she saw that there was no one around her she started crawling to the entryway they saw that she was still alive and came back they were already at the third entryway on their way to the gambarians' they came back and started beating her to finish her if she had not come to she would have sustained lesser bodily injuries they would have beat her less an older woman from our building aunt nazan an azerbaijani all but lay on top of karina crying and pleading that they leave her alone but they flung her off the woman's grown sons were right nearby they picked her up in their hands and led her home she howled and cried out loudly and swore god is on earth he sees everything and he won't forgive this there was another woman too aunt fatima a sick aging woman from the first floor she's already retired mountain dwellers and azerbaijanis too have a custom if men are fighting they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them but they trampled her scarf and sent her home to trample a scarf is tantamount to trampling a woman's honor now that the investigation is going on now that a lot is behind us and we have gotten back to being ourselves a little i think about how could these events that are now called the sumgait tragedy happen how did they come about how did it start could it have been avoided well it's clear that without a signal without permission from the top leadership it would not have happened all the same i'm not afraid to say this the azerbaijanis let other worthy people take no offense the better representatives of their nations let them take no offense but the azerbaijanis in their majority are a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law fear of retribution for what they have done and when the law said that they could do all that like unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything they threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done to snatch a bit more the smell of the danger was already in the air on february NUM you could tell that something was going to happen and everyone who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs many left for their dachas got plane tickets for the other end of the country just got as far away as their legs would carry them february NUM was a saturday i was teaching my third class the director came into my classroom and said that i should let the children out that there had been a call from the city party committee asking that all teachers gather for a meeting at lenin square well i excused the children and there were few teachers left at school altogether three women the director and six or seven men the rest had already gone home we got to lenin square and there were a great many people there this was around fivethirty or six in the evening no later they were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and the crowd below was supporting them stormily roaring they spoke over the microphone about what had happened in kafan a few days earlier and that the driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small azerbaijani child off the bus the speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness that he had seen it himselfthe crowd started to rage death to the armenians they must be killed then a woman went up on stage i didn't see the woman because people were clinging to the podium like flies i could only hear her the woman introduced herself as coming from kafan and said that the armenians cut her daughters' breasts off and called sons avenge my daughters that was enough a portion of the people on the square took off running in the direction of the factories toward the beginning of lenin street we stood there about an hour then the director of school NUM spoke he gave a very nationalist speech he said brother muslims kill the armenians this he repeated every other sentence when he said this the crowd supported him stormily whistling and shouting karabagh he said karabagh has been our territory my whole life long karabagh is my soul how can you tear out my heart as though an azerbaijani would die without karabagh it's our territory the armenians will never see it the armenians must be eliminated from time immemorial muslims have cleansed the land of infidel armenians from time immemorial that's the way nature created it that every NUM to NUM years the azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth by filth he meant armenians i heard this before that i hadn't been listening to the speeches closely many people spoke and i stood with my back to the podium talking shop with the other teachers and somehow it all went right by it didn't penetrate that in fact something serious was taking place then when one of our teachers said listen to what he's saying listen to what idiocy he's spouting we listened that was the speech of that director before that we listened to the woman's speech right then in our groupthere were nine of usthe mood changed and the subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten our director of studies for whom i had great respect he's an azerbaijani before that i had considered him an upstanding and worthy person if there was a need to obtain leave we had asked him he seemed like a good person so he tells me lyuda you know that besides you there are no armenians on the square if they find out that you're an armenian they'll tear you to pieces should i tell them you're an armenian should i tell them you're an armenian when he said it the first time i pretended not to hear it and then he asked me a second time i turned to the director khudurova and said that it was already after eight i was expected at home and i should be leaving she answered no they said that women should stay here until ten o'clockand men until twelve stay here there was a young teacher with us her children were in kindergarten and her husband worked shifts she asked to leave i left my children at the kindergarten the director excused her when she let her go i turned around said goodbye and left with the young teacher the azerbaijani i didn't see them after that when we were walking the buses weren't running and a crowd from the rally ran nearby us they had apparently gotten all fired up it must have become too much for them and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately so they rushed off i wasn't afraid this time because i was sure that the other teacher wouldn't say that i was an armenian to make it short we reached home then karina told of how they had been at the movies and what had happened there i started telling of my experience and again my parents didn't understand that we were in danger we watched television as usual and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last day that's how it all was at the city party committee i met an acquaintance we went to school together zhanna i don't remember her last name she lives above the housewares store on narimanov street she was there with her father for some reason she doesn't have a mother the two of them were at home alone while her father held the door she jumped from the third floor and she was lucky that the ground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went out on the balcony there was no one there they were all standing near the entryway that building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders there she jumped she jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the moment a few days later i found out that she couldn't stand up she had been injured somehow that's how people in sumgait saved their lives their honor and their children any way they could where it was possible the armenians fought back my father's first cousin armen m lives in block NUM they found out by phone from one of the victims what was going on in town the armenians in that building all called one another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes knives even with muskets and went up to the roof they took their infants with them and their old women who had been in bed for god knows how many months they got them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs they hooked electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited ready to fight then they took the daughter of the school board director hostage she's an azerbaijani who lived in their building they called the school board director and told her that if she didn't help them the NUM armenians on the roof to escape alive and unharmed she'd never see her daughter again i'm sure of course that armenians would never lay a hand on a woman it was just the only thing that could have saved them at the time she called the police the armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town two armored personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned they surrounded the entryway and led everyone down from the roof and off to the side from the armored personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that very moment into block NUM that's how they defended themselves i heard that our neighbors roman and sasha gambarian resisted they're big strong guys their father was killed and i heard that the brothers put up a strong defense and lost their father but were able to save their mother one of the neighbors told me that after it happened when they were looking for the criminals on march NUM to NUM and detaining everyone they suspected people hid people in our entryway maybe people who were injured or perhaps dead the neighbors themselves were afraid to go there and when they went with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found azerbaijani corpses i don't know how many even if they had been wounded and put down there after two days they would have died from loss of blood or infectionthat basement was filled with water i heard this from the neighbors and later when i was talking with the investigators the subject came up and they confirmed it i know too that for several hours the basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment and our neighbor carried out our carpet along with the rest he stole it for himself posing as one of the criminals everyone was taking his own share and the neighbor took his too and carried it home and when we came back when everything seemed to have calmed down he returned it saying that it was the only thing of ours he had managed to save raya's husband and father defended themselves the trdatovs defended themselves and so did other armenian families to be sure there were azerbaijani victims although we'll never hear anything about them for some reason our government doesn't want to say that the armenians were not just victims but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers too in the tv show pozitsiya viewpoint a military man an officer said that the armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves but that's not important the truth will come out regardless so that's the price we paid those three days for three days our courage our bravery and our humanity was tested it was those three days and not the years and dozens of years we had lived before them that showed what we've become what we grew up to be those three days showed who was who on that i will conclude my narrative on the sumgait tragedy it should be said that it's not over yet the trials are still ahead of us and the punishments received by those who so violated us who wanted to make us into nonhumans will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators the procuracy and literally of every

one brought up as most americans have been in the gladstonian and foreignmissionary tradition the condition of the jews in turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every nation in the world would have treated as treasonable one readily reaches the conclusion that the jews in turkey were fortunate he also stated that they armenians traitorously turned turkish cities over to the russian invader that they boasted of having raised an army of

1483500352igcapcorg center for policy research cprigcapcorg writes from center for policy research cpr subject rejoinder questions to israelis to shaigthinkcom subject ten questions to israelis dear shai in the answer to my first question concerning the nonexistence of israeli nationality your answer conflicts with information i have received from other quarters according to which there are two distinct categories of classifying israelis citizenship ezrahut and nationality le'um the former is used on passports etc and the later for daily identification in israeli society i am told that people in israel have to carry their id cards at all times and present them at many public places almost every day these id cards make clear who the holder is a jew or an arab you maintain that this mainly because of religious services provided but do you really believe that this is the reason could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it serves no other purpose a number of points you are making assumptions about the manner in which the cards are used true by law all residents citizens and tourists must carry a form of identification with them for citizens the standard id is the id card the purpose this serves on a daily basis wherein they are presented at public places is for the purpose of identifying the bearer this takes place in banks cashing checks post offices registered mail and such etc quite frankly it was rare that i ever had to present my id card for such activities more than once per week there is no law or requirement that forces people to wave their id cards in public furthermore none of the services i outlined discriminate against the bearer in any manner by having access to this information the only case that i can think of in which the le'um field might be taken into account is during interaction with the police based upon the scenario in general though arab citizens are clearly recognizable as are nonarabs your argument therefore becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field is being used to discriminate against them officially in the answer to my second questions concerning the fact that israel has no fixed borders you state that israel's borders were 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace' according to what i read the first zionists in the beginning of the century had plans for the jewish state to extend into what is lebanon and into transjordan jordan i also read that it was the express wish of bengurion to not declare israel's borders when israel was established as this might restrict israel's opportunities for later expansion israel often claims it right of existence on the fact that jews lived there NUM years ago or that god promised the land to them but according to biblical sources the area god promised would extend all the way to iraq and what were the borders in biblical times which israel considers proper to use today finally if israel wants peace why can't it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders which might be a base for negotiations having all the above facts in mind one cannot blame arab countries to fear israeli expansionism as a number of wars have proved NUM NUM NUM NUM i take issue with your assertions i think that arab countries do know that they have nothing to fear from israeli expansionism militarily israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of land under occupation to a hostile armed and insurgent population for a sustained period of time as is the intifada is heavily taxing the israeli economy proof of this can be seen in the israeli withdrawal from lebanon israeli troops pulled back from the awali and later from the litani in order to control the minimal strip needed to keep towns out of range of katyusha missile fire public opinion in israel has turned towards settling the intifada via territorial concessions the israel public is sufferring from battle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it with regards to borders let me state the following i may not agree with the manner in which negotiations are being held however the crux of the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating a starting position the arab parties have called for total withdrawal and a return to pre48 borders if israel were to state large borders the negotiations might never get under way if israel were to state smaller borders then the arab countries might try and force even smaller borders during the negotiations i think that leaving the matter to be settled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic and sensible your answer to my third question is typical of a stalinist public official i don't think your answer is honest you refer me to vanunu's revelations about israel's nuclear arsenal without evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations now if he said the truth then why should he been punished and if he lied why should he be punished i would appreciate more honesty your statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a center for policy research whether or not all of vanunu's revelations were true has no bearing on the fact that some were for disclosing state secrets after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that said secrets are not to be made public one should be punished as to which were and which weren't i am under no moral obligation to disclose that quite the reverse in fact he was taken to court tried and found guilty you may take issue with a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the concept of secrets of state something which every democratic govt has somebody provided an answer to the fourth question concerning 'hidden prisoners' in israeli prisons he posted an article from ma'ariv documenting such cases it seems that such prisoners do exist in israel what do you think about that i noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist more than he documented the fact that they do exist the clu noted which you evidently did not pay attention to that they know of no such reports or cases i am sorry to tell you but in a country of NUM mill as tightly knit as israel even if the matter of the arrest was not made public within a relatively short time frame most people would know about it my own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be made public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of x hours this would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an announcement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation you imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a way to 'cast aspersions upon israel' such terms have often been used by the soviet union against dissidents they call the soviet union into disrepute if my questions are not disturbing they would not call forth such hysterical answers my questions are clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts i would be very happy if you could convince me that what i am told about israel were just fabrications but alas you have failed to do so i suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discussion this is a sign of weakness not of strength well i am sorry to say that your questions are slanted such questions are often termed tabloid journalism and are not disturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity such questions were often used during the mccarthy era as a basis for the witchhunts that took place then to use your own example these questions might have been lifted from the format used by stalinist prosecutors that were looking for small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray as a larger and dirtier picture my answers were not any more hysterical than the questions themselves the problem is not that the q's were provocative it was that they were selective in their fact seeking you fall into the same category of those who seek yes no answers when the real answer is of sorts i suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an unequivocal no you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete them as you see fit a sign of strength is the ability to look you remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated culling wolves because of the cruelty to deer only to find that they had broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment they sought to protect the color blindness you exhibit is a true sign of weakness i hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth ditto shai

namecalling hence the assumption do you feel more up to it now so that we might have an answer or to refresh your memory does the human right issue in the area apply to palestinians only also do you claim there is such a thing as forfeiting a human right if that's possible then explain to the rest of us how there can exist any such thing use your logic and convince us this is your golden chance jonas flygare well ok let's see what master of wisdom mr jonas flygare wrote that can be wisdomely responded to are you calling names or giving me a title if the first read your paragraph above if not i accept the title in order to let you get into the um well debate again master of wisdom writes in 1993mar31101957frejteknikumuuse hasan flax hasan in case you didnot know palestineans were there for NUM months and they are coming back when you agree to give palestineans their humanrights afterall human rights arenot negotiable correct me if i'm wrong but isn't the right to one's life also a 'human right' or does it only apply to palestinians no it is everybody's right however when a killer kills then he is giving up willingly or unwillingly his life's right to the society the society represented by the goverment would exercise its duty by depriving the killer off his life's right so then it's all right for israel to kill the people who kill israelis the old 'eye for an eye' thinking funny i thought modern legal systems were made to counter exactly that so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom if you insist on giving me namestitles i did not ask for you could at least spell them correctly sigh when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on the ground of occupied territories no i am not neglecting that i'm merely asking you whether the existance of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right to live a as you so eloquently put it human right we can get back to the question of which law should be used in the territories later also you have not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights what do you expect me to tell you master of wisdom when i did explain my point in the post that you responded to the point is that since israel is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights to the occupied palestineans which is exactly similar the automatic deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society if a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions then tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all in conjugtion with the above when a group of people occupies others territories and rule them by force then this group would be willingly or unwillingly deprived from some of its rights such as the right to live that's nice the swedish government is a group of people that rule me by force does that give me the right to kill them do you consider yourself that you have posed a worthy question here worthy or not i was just applying your logic to a related problem am i to assume you admit it wouldn't hold what kind of rights and how much would be deprived is another issue the answer is to be found in a certain system such as international law us law israeli law and now it's very convenient to start using the legal system to prove a point excuse me while i throw up ok master of wisdom is throwing up you people stay away from the screen while he is doing it oh did you too watch that comedy where they pipe water through the telephone i'll let you in on a secret it's not for real take my word for it it seems that the us law represented by us state dept in this case is looking to the other way around when violence occurs in occupied territories anyway as for hamas then obviously they turned to the islamic system and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem the question is not which system would solve the me problem why because any system can solve it the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine i asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for all people involved i assumed that was obvious but i won't repeat that mistake now that i have straightened that out i'm eagerly awaiting your reply joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization said it best when writing in his diary in NUM between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country the only solution is a palestine at least western palestine west of the jordan river without arabs and there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be left only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the millions of our own brethren there is no other way out davar NUM september NUM courtesy of marc afifi just a question if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas charter that's the english translations if you have other information i'd be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to a private paper even older i'm not going to get into the question if he wrote the above but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics guess what those are not the people that will make any lasting peace in the region ever it's those who are willing to make a tabula rasa and start over and willing to give in order to get something back we and our either refers to zionists or jews i donot know which well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem i think that is fair enough no that is not an answer since i asked for a system that could solve the problem you said any could be used then you provided a contradiction guess where that takes your logic to nevernever land the greatest problem of zionism is arab children rabbi shoham oh and by the way let me add that

zionism and the holocaust by haim bresheeth the first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history of the holocaust by zionist propaganda is that zionism without antisemitism is impossible zionism agrees with the basic tenet of antisemitism namely that jews cannot live with non jews the history and roots of the holocaust go back a long way while the industru of death and destruction did not operate before NUM its roots were firmly placed in the 19th century jewish aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles in europe when the hopes for liberation through bourgeoisdemocratic change were dashed other alternatives for improving the lot of the jews of europe achieved prominence the socialist bund a mass movement with enormous following had to contend with opposition from a new and small almost insignificant opponent the political zionists in outline these two offered diametrically opposed options for jews in europe while the bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of europe's workers the zionists were proposing a new programme aimed at ridding europe of its jews by setting up some form of a jewish state historically nothing is inevitable all depends on the balance of forces involved in the struggle history can be seen as an option tree every time a certain option is chosen other routes become barred because of that choice movement backwards to the point before that choice was made is impossible while zionism as an option was taken by many young jews it remained a minority position until the first days of the 3rd reich the zionist federation of germany zvfd an organisation representing a tiny minority of german jews was selected by the nazis as the body to represent the jews of the reich its was the only flag of an interantional organisation allowed to fly in berlin and this was the only international organisation allowed to operate during this period from a marginal position the leaders of the zionist federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that surprised even them all of a sudden they attained political power power based not on representation but from being selected as the choice of the nazi regime for dealing with the the 'jewish problem' their position in negotiating with the nazis agreements that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the jews in germany transformed them from a utopian marginal organisation in germany and some other countries in europe into a real option to be considered by german jews the best example of this was the 'transfer agreement' of NUM immediately after the nazi takeover in NUM jews all over the world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of german goods this campaign hurt the nazi regime and the german authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott it was clear that if jews and jewish organisations were to pull out the campaign would collapse this problem was solved by the zvfd a letter sent to the nazi party as early as NUM june NUM outlined the degree of agreement that existed between the two organisations on the question of race nation and the nature of the 'jewish problem' and it offered to collaborate with the new regime the realisation of zionism could only be hurt by resentment of jews abroad against the german development boycott propaganda such as is currently being carried out against germany in many ways is in essence unzionist because zionism wants not to do battle but to convince and build in their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime the zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott the main public act was the signature of the transfer agreement with the nazi authorities during the zionist congress of NUM in essence the agreement was designed to get germany's jews out of the country and into mandate palestine it provided a possibility for jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country through a transfer of german goods to palestine this right was denied to jews leaving to any other destination the zionist organisation was the acting agent through its financial organisations this agreement operated on a number of fronts 'helping' jews to leave the country breaking the ring of the boycott exporting german goods in large quantities to palestine and last but not least enabling the regime to be seen as humane and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies the jews after all they argued the jews do not belong in europe and now the jews come and agree with them after news of the agreement broke the boycott was doomed if the zionist organization found it possible and necessary to deal with the nazis and import their goods who could argue for a boycott this was not the first time that the interests of both movements were presented to the german public as complementary baron von mildenstein the first head of the jewish department of the ss later followed by eichmann was invited to travel to palestine this he did in early NUM in the company of a zionist leader kurt tuchler having spent six months in palestine he wrote a series of favourable articles in der sturmer describing the 'new jew' of zionism a jew nazis could accept and understand this littleknown episode established quite clearly the relationship during the early days of nazism between the new regime and the zvfd a relationship that was echoed later in a number of key instances even after the nature of the final solution became clear in many cases this meant a silencing of reports about the horrors of the exterminations a book concentrating on this aspect of the zionist reaction to the holocaust is postugandan zionism in the crucible of the holocaust by s b bethzvi in the case of the kastner episode around which jim allen's play perdition is based even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of events does not exist it occured near the end of the war the ussr had advanced almost up to germany italy and the african bases had been lost the nazis were on the run with a number of key countries such as rumania leaving the axis a second front was a matter of months away as the western allies prepared their forces in the midst of all this we find eichmann the master bureaucrat of industrial murder setting up his hz in occupied budapest after the german takeover of the country in april NUM his first act was to have a conference with the jewish leadership and to appoint zionist federation members headed by kastner as the agent and clearing house for all jews and their relationship with the ss and the nazr authorities why they did this is not difficult to see as opposed to poland where its three and a half million jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly different from the rest of the polish population the hungarian jews were an integrated part of the community the middle class was mainly jewish the jews were mainly middleclass they enjoyed freedom of travel served in the hungarian fascist army in fronline units as officers and soldiers their names were hungarian how was eichmann to find them if they were to be exterminated the task was not easy there were a million jews in hungary most of them resident the rest being refugees from other countries many had heard about the fate of jews elsewhere and were unlikely to believe any statements by nazi officials like elsewhere the only people who had the information and the ear of the frightened jewish population were the judenrat in this case the judenrat comprsied mainly the zionist federation members without their help the ss with NUM officers and less than NUM men plus a few hundred hungarian police could not have collected and controlled a million jews when they did not even know their whereabouts kastner and the others were left under no illusions eichmann told joel brand one of the members of kastner's committee that he intended to send all hungary's jews to auschwitz before he even started the expulsions he told them clearly that all these jews will die NUM a day unless certain conditions were met the committee faced a simple choice to tell the jews of hungary about their fate with neutral rumania where many could escape being in most cases a few hours away or to collaborate with the nazis by assisting in the concentration process what would not have been believed when coming from the ss sounded quite plausible when coming from the mouths of the zionist leadership thus it is that most of the hungarian jews went quietly to their death assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to work camps to be sure there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of destruction the trains of 'prominents' which eichmann promised to kastner a promise he kept to the last detail for eichmann it was a bargain allowing NUM jews to survive as the price paid for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million jews there was no way in which the jews of hungary could even be located not to say murdered without the full collaboration of kastner and his few friends no doubt the ss would hunt a few jews here and there but the scale of the operation would have been miniscule compared to the half million who died in auschwitz it is important to realise that kastner was not an aberration like say rumkovsky in lodz kastner acted as a result of his strongly held zionist convictions his actions were a logical outcome of earlier positions this is instanced when he exposed to the gestapo the existence of a british cell of saboteurs palgi and senesh and persuaded them to give themselves up so as not to disrupt his operations at no point during his trial or elsewhere did kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those jews to conclude the role played by zionists in this period was connected to another role they could and should have played that of alarming the whole world to what was happening in europe they had the information but politically it was contrary to their priorities the priorities were and still are quite simple all that furthers the zionist enterprise in palestine is followed whatever the price the lives of individuals jews and nonjews are secondary if this process requires dealing with fascists nazis and other assorted dictatorial regimes across the world so be it\",\n",

with disclosures about what happened to them and they think that to most of their fellows from the cherry it woundn't be easy either yet after they began to talk it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking the following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness a short time ago i was in command of a veteran team in which some of the fellows applied for release from the cherry we called such soldiers hi 'hit by the intifada' under my command was a soldier who talked to himself nonstop which is a common phenomenon in the cherry i sent him to a psychiatrist but why i should talk about others when i myself feel quite insane on fridays when i come home my parents know i cannot be talked to until i go to the beach surf a little calm down and return the keys of my father's car must be ready for in advance so that i can go there i they dare talk to me before or whenever i don't want them to talk to me i just grab a chair and smash it instantly i know it is my nerve smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home to the car and to the beach only there i become normal another friday i was eating a lunch prepared by my mother it was an omelette of sorts she took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me i then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind i told her how i shot an arab and how exactly his wound looked like when i went to inspect it she began to laugh hysterically i wanted her to cry and she dared laugh straight in my face instead so i told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two arabs who were preparing the molotov cocktails he shot them down hitting them beautifully exactly as they deserved one bullet had set a molotov cocktail on fire with the effect that the arab was burning all over just beautifully i was delighted to see it my pal fired three bullets two at the arab with the molotov cocktail and the third at his chum it hit him straight in his ass we both felt that we'd pulled off something next i told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look i reached the spot first and then that arab blood gushing forth from his body spits at me i yelled 'shut up' and he dared talk back to me in hebrew so i just laughed straight in his face i am usually laughing when i stare at something convulsing right before my eyes then i told him 'all right wait a moment' i left him in order to take a look at another wounded arab i asked a soldier if that arab could be saved if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that i keep telling all this to my mother with details and she keeps laughing straight into my face this infuriated me i got very angry because i felt i was becoming mad so i stopped eating seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on and at once threw it over her head only then she stopped laughing at first she didn't know what to say but i must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently i went with a friend to practice shooting on a field a gull appeared right in the middle of the field my friend shot it at once then we noticed four deer standing high up on the sigh four NUM deer in tel aviv well this is probably as accurate as the rest of this fantasy hill above us my friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it we enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock we shot down two deer more and went to take a look when we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer badly wounded by our bullet but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother we carefully inspected two paths covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit we were just delighted by that sight we had hit'em so good then we decided to kill the young deer too so as spare it further suffering i approached took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance when you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in but my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us this made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness standing there soaked with blood we felt we were like beasts of prey we couldn't explain what had happened to us we were almost in tears while walking down from that hill and we felt the whole day very badly we always go back to places we carried out assignments in this is why we can see

way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives tell me tim what are these guerillas doing wrong assuming that they are using civilians for cover assuming also come on brad if we are going to get anywhere in this or any discussion it doesn't help to bring up elements i never addressed nor commented on in any way i made no comment on who is right or who is wrong only that civilians are being used as cover and that having been placed in between the israelis and the guerillas they will be injured as both parties continue their fight the purpose of an army's use of military uniforms is to set its members apart from the civilians so that civilians will not be thought of by the other side as combatants so what do you think is the meaning behind the intention and the effect when an army purposely does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to look like civilians' they are judging that the benefit they will receive from this cover is more important that the harm that will come to civilians this is a comment on the israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas do have some responsibility in putting civilians in the middle of this fight by putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians barracks etc the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians but if the guerillas do this aren't they putting themselves at greater risk absolutely they ask themselves why set ourselves apart by wearing uniforms when there is a readymade cover for us civilians that makes sense from their point of view but when this cover is used the guerillas should accept some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians if the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on israel is it not working why is it further neccessary for israeli guns to pound lebanese villages why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone you see there is more to the shelling of the villages it is called retaliation getting backgetting even it doesn't make sense to shell the villages the least it shows is a reckless disregard by the israeli government for the lives of civilians i agree with you here i have always thought that israel's bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid thoughtless inhumane and ineffective but there is no reason that israel should passive wait until attackers chose to act there is every reason to believe that taking the fight to the enemy will do more to stop attacks as i said previously israel spent several decades sitting passively on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks after the attackers had entered israeli territory it didn't work very well the host arab state did littlenothing to try and stop these attacks from its side of the border with israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher as was their physical and psychological impact on the civilians caught in their path whatso the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states can start all over again while i also hope for this to happen it will only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their soil they have to prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance towards antiisrael guerillas inresidence if israel is not willing to accept the word of others then imho it has no business wasting others' time coming to the peace talks this is just another selectively applied statement the reason for this drawnout impasse between ababspalestinians and israelis is that neither side is willing to accept the word of the other by your criteria everyone should stay away from the negotiations that is precisely why the palestinians in their recent pisga proposal for the interim period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy are demanding conditions that essentially define autonomy already they do not trust that israel will follow through the entire process and allow palestinians to reach full autonomy do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the palestinians if you do then why should israel's view of arabspalestinians be any different why should they trust the arabpalestinians' words since they don't they are very reluctant to give up tangible assets land control of areas in exchange for words for this reason they are also concerned about the sorts of guarantees they will have that the arabs will follow through on their part of any agreement reached but don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways if lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word of israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy absolutely so are the arabspalestinians asking first for the israelis word in relation to any agreement no what is being demanded first is land when the issue is land and one party finally gets hold of this land what the other party does is totally irrelevent if i now have possession of this land your words have absolutely no power whether israel chooses to keeps its word does not get the land back afterall israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas it occupied in lebanon during slg tim you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians in lebanon have been disarmed hezbollah remains the only independent militia hezbollah does not attack israel except at a few times such as when the idf burned up sheikh mosavi his wife and young son while the major armaments those allowing people to wage civil wars have been removed the weapons needed to crossborder attacks still remain to some extent rocket attacks still continue and commando raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life yours of that of others such attacks also continue of course if israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't make the lebanese so mad as to do that bat guano the situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks were commonplace furthermore with hezbollah subsequently disarmed it would not be possible there is no way these groups can be effectively disarmed unless the state is as authoritarian is syria's the only other way is for lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with israel essentially mirroring israel's border secirity on its side it has to prove to isreal that it is this committed to protecting israel from attack from lebanese territory once syria leaves who is to say that lebanon will be able to retain control if syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for israel tim when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the syrian border not lately eh that's what i said ok but doesn't that mean that syria has to take over lebanon i don't think israel or lebanon would like that what both sides need is to receive something tangible the arabs palestinians are looking for land and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to israel israel has two problems NUM if it gives up real land it is exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation and that change doesn't help israel's position and NUM when it gives up this land it needs to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks tim\",\n",

in western thrace a much bigger turkish minority the 'pomaks' are also a muslim people whom all the three nations bulgarians turks and greeks consider as part of themselves do you know how the muslim turkish minority was organized according to the agreements poor 'poly' it also proves that the turkish people are trapped in greece and the greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world the

commander of the first army corps general kaltiyin remained in power troops including armenian enlisted men were not sent to the area when the security measures were lifted the armenians began to attack erzurum and its surroundings following the attacks came the plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder of the owners of these housesplundering was widely committed by the soldiers this plunder was mainly committed by armenian soldiers who had remained in the rear during the war one day while passing through the streets on horseback a group of soldiers including an armenian soldier began to drag two old men of seventy years in a certain direction the roads were covered with mud and these people were dragging the two helpless turks through the mud and dirt it was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and traps the turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds and withdrew the reason was that most of the turks who were on night patrol did not return and no one knew what had happened to them the turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear also finally the court martial which had been established for the trials of murderers and plunderers began to liquidate itself for fear that they themselves would be punished the incidents of murder and rape which had decreased began to occur more frequently sometime in january and february a leading turkish citizen haci bekir efendi from erzurum was killed one night at his home the commander in chief odiselidge gave orders to find murderers within three days the commander in chief has bitterly reminded the armenian intellectuals that disobedience among the armenian enlisted men had reached its highest point that they had insulted and robbed the people and half of the turks sent outside the city had not returned we learnt the details this incident from the commanderinchief odishelidge they were as follows the killings were organized by the doctors and the employers and the act of killing was committed solely by the armenian renegades more than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless turks have been killed in erzincan large holes were dug and the defenceless turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes later the murdered turks were thrown into the holes the armenian who stood near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses 'seventy dead bodies well this hole can take ten more' thus ten more turks would be cut into pieces thrown into the hole and when the hole was full it would be covered over with soil the armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently fill a house with eighty turks and cut their heads off one by one following the erzincan massacre the armenians began to withdraw towards erzurum the armenian renegades among those who withdrew to erzurum from erzincan raided the moslem villages on the road and destroyed the entire population together with the villages during the transportation of the cannons ammunition and the carriages that were outside the war area certain people were hired among the kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages while the travellers were passing through erzurum the armenians took advantage of the time when the russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill the kurds they had hired when the russian soldiers heard the cries of the dying kurds they attempted to help them however the armenians threatened the russian soldiers by vowing that they would have the same fate if they intervened and thus prevented them from acting all these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with hatred and loathing lieutenant medivani from the russian army described an incident that he witnessed in erzurum as follows an armenian had shot a kurd the kurd fell down but did not die the armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying kurd however since the kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony the armenian failed in his attempt having seen this the armenian ripped open the abdomen of the kurd disembowelled him and finally killed him by stamping him with the iron heel of his boot odishelidge himself told us that all the turks who could not escape from the village of ilica were killed their heads had been cut off by axes he also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered children lieutenant colonel gryaznov who passed through the village of ilica three weeks after the massacre told us the following there were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces on the roads every armenian who happened to pass through these roads cursed and spat on the corpses in the courtyard of a mosque which was about 25x30 meter square dead bodies were piled to a height of NUM centimeters among these corpses were men and women of every age children and old people the women's bodies had obvious marks of rape the genitals of many girls were filled with gunpowder a few educated armenian girls who worked as telephone operators for the armenian troops were called by lieutenant colonel gryaznov to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be proud of what the armenians had done to the lieutenant colonel's disgusted amazement the armenian girls started to laugh and giggle instead of being horrified the lieutenant colonel had severely reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour when he told the girls that the armenians including women were generally more licentious than even the wildest animals and that their indecent and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity and barbarity before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers the armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and claimed they had laughed because they were nervous an armenian contractor at the alaca communication zone command narrated the following incident which took place on february NUM the armenians had nailed a turkish

were murdered on the streets on february NUM some armenians have shot more than ten innocent moslems the russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were threatened with death meanwhile i imprisoned an armenian for murdering an innocent turk when an armenian officer told an armenian murderer that he would be hanged for his crime the killer shouted furiously 'how dare you hang an armenian for killing a turk' in erzurum the armenians burned down the turkish market on february NUM i heard that the entire population of tepekoy village situated within the artillery area had been totally annihilated on the same day when antranik entered erzurum i reported the massacre to him and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible act however no result was achieved in the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred there was a natural silence on the night of NUM february the armenians deceived the russians perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the turkish soldiers later it was understood that this massacre had been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular the population had been herded in a certain place and then killed one by one the number of murders committed on that night reached three thousand it was the armenians who bragged to about the details of the massacre the armenians fighting against the turkish soldiers were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even withstand the turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred people and two cannons for one night and ran away the leading armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre however the armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with the renegades in this massacre just as in all the others the lower classes within the armenian community have always obeyed the orders of the leading armenian figures and commanders i do not like to give the impression that all armenian intellectuals were accessories to these murders no for there were people who opposed the armenians for such actions since they understood that it would yield no result however such people were only a minority furthermore such people were considered as traitors to the armenian cause some have seemingly opposed the armenian murders but have supported the massacres secretly some on the other hand preferred to remain silent there were certain others

formed a tight circle around it i ask what's going on someone tells me come listen well they were azerbaijanis i had asked in azerbaijani i hear appeals brother muslims our time has come and something

demonstrations there well people were saying all kinds of things but i didn't have any idea what was really going on my wife and son were at home but my daughter was at my aunt's house in baku i didn't say anything to my wife we sat and drank tea sometime around two o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise whistling and shouting i looked out the window and saw a crowd the crowd is moving slowly like they show on tv when blacks in south africa are striking or having a demonstration and move slowly my wife asks what's going on out there i say i don't know i put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about in the crowd people are shouting down with the armenians and death to the armenians i waited for the entire crowd to pass at first they went down narimanov street on the side with the sk club and the city party committee then they turned and went against the trafficit's one way theredown the street of the NUM baku commissars toward the streetcar line i went home and told my wife there was a demonstration going on in fact i thought that we were having the same kind of demonstrations that they had had in yerevan and in karabagh aside from the things they were shouting i was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd and they were minors under draft age my wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend but i was kind of uneasy and said no let's stay at home instead an hour went by or maybe an hour and a half well i wasn't keeping track of the time i can't say exactly how long it was i look and see another crowd on narimanov but now on the side with the microdistricts the bazaar and the rossiya movie theater i put outside clothes on and went out again there's noise an uproar outside and the crowd has grown there are more people and whereas the first time there were individual shouts this time they are more focused more aggressive no i think something's wrong here this isn't any demonstration they would run stop then walk quickly and make sharp dashes and then run again i was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street i followed them i was thinking i'd just watch and see who knew where this was leading we came out on lenin square at the square the sk club is on one side and the city party committee is on the other i went toward the square and heard noise and shouting as though the whole town had turned out there was some sort of a rally going on i go closer and hear exclamations appeals i heard both antiarmenian and antisoviet appeals we don't need perestroika we want to go on living like we have been now what did they mean by living like we have been the azerbaijanis work like everyone else but too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense of others speculation theft and cheating go on all the time and not just in azerbaijan everywhere in all the republics but i've never seen it anywhere else like i have in azerbaijan now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the armenians' apartments and drive them out beat them and drive them out true i didn't hear them say kill them over the microphone i only heard beat them and drive them out i stayed at the square a few minutes longer first one then another are going up onto the stage and no one tries to stop the crowd off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people and i think they were mvd ministry of internal affairs or state security kgb there were also uniformed policemen there but i didn't see any of them try to pacify the crowd new people kept coming up onto the stage well i had finally decided that this could end badly this was no demonstration and i had to protect my family i left the square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck it was next to the city party committee on narimanov street it stood next to the tai lor's shop there a low truck and it had low wooden panels i see that some thing is being unloaded crates of some sort i decided to go look because after all those appeals i was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there they pulled the crates out onto the square not toward the city party committee but toward the sk club and when i went right up to them i saw that they were cases of vodka there were two people handing down the cases from the bed of the truck and on the ground there were many people NUM to NUM they were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried off by two people two people one case of vodka and there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps maybe about the size of a fist maybe a little bigger or smaller it was anasha when i passed next to that person he stood with his side to me there was about a yard and a half between us and two people were standing near him he has a package in his hand and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out i have never smoked it myself once i tried it for fun but i've seen a lot of people smoke it i've seen it many times and i know what it is i strolled around and no one asked me who i was or what i was doing there before i got to the glass bazaar i heard more howling more warlike shouting i turned around and saw them running well i'll just keep on going like i am i thought when they caught up with me i saw that they were carrying flags and i recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the street he's a young guy NUM or NUM years old he was carrying a red flag which had ermeni oryum written on it in azerbaijani that means death to armenians that guy used to live off the same courtyard as us i don't really know what his name is but i know his father very well his father's name is rafik he used to be a cook and then became head chef he used to have a dark blue zhiguli van then he sold it and now he has a white zhiguli NUM his family as i said lived on the same courtyard as we did our building was on narimanov

heard got a new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict in a word his son was carrying a flag that said death to armenians i was surprised because before this i had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being done not by people from sumgait but by azerbaijanis from agdam and kafan well anyway i went home my wife was upset i told her it's ok it'll pass they're young kids they've just gotten all whooped up naturally i didn't want her to get overly upset after a while a new surge of crowd went by and this time they were breaking glass i could hear it breaking but i couldn't see where well i think here we go the machine's in motion they weren't handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing i didn't see people drinking and smoking on the spot but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and hashish to put in a store window so the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running no one would stop them now they weren't even trying although i'll say it again the police were there i saw them and it's not just that the police weren't breaking them up they were joking with them they were having a good time true at the time i couldn't even imagine that under our government our much vaunted leadershipand i'm not afraid to say these words so many people died so many women were abused and how many abominations there werei couldn't imagine that under our muchvaunted authorities and if i were to be specific i would say under the muchtouted authorities in our city of sumgait i couldn't imagine that such things could take place when they started breaking glass i told my wife and son let's go upstairs we went to our neighbors the grigorians on the fourth floor and in the evening when those crowds started going past again i went outside once more i stopped at the corner a place called that right next to the bazaar i look and see a crowd on the run and there a few yards from the entrance to the bazaar are three respectablelooking men of around say NUM years old the crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed toward the bazaar and then the whole crowd as though it were one person wheeled and raced toward

back when you agree to give palestineans their humanrights afterall human rights arenot negotiable correct me if i'm wrong but isn't the right to one's life also a 'human right' or does it only apply to palestinians no it is everybody's right however when a killer kills then he is giving up willingly or unwillingly his life's right to the society the society represented by the goverment would exercise its duty by depriving the killer off his life's right so then it's all right for israel to kill the people who kill israelis the old 'eye for an eye' thinking funny i thought modern legal systems were made to counter exactly that so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom if you insist on giving me namestitles i did not ask for you could at least spell them correctly sigh that was only to confuse you ha ha ha hey when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on the ground of occupied territories no i am not neglecting that i'm merely asking you whether the existance of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right are you trying to retaliate and confuse me here to live a as you so eloquently put it human right we can get back to the question of which law should be used in the territories later also you have not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens in the wb revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation of the wb revoke the right of life for somemost its citizens basically revokes the right of for its military men clearly occupation is an undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment to protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing palestinean human rights what do you expect me to tell you master of wisdom when i did explain my point in the post that you responded to the point is that since israel is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights to the occupied palestineans which is exactly similar the automatic deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society if a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions then tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all because not all states are like israel as oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant what kind of rights and how much would be deprived is another issue the answer is to be found in a certain system such as international law us law israeli law deleted jonas was throwing upnot for real so you can stick to the screen it seems that the us law represented by us state dept in this case is looking to the other way around when violence occurs in occupied territories anyway as for hamas then obviously they turned to the islamic system and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem the question is not which system would solve the me problem why because any system can solve it the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine i asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for all people involved i assumed that was obvious but i won't repeat that mistake now that i have straightened that out i'm eagerly awaiting your reply so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization said it best when writing in his diary in NUM between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country the only solution is a palestine at least western palestine west of the jordan river without arabs and there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries

if he wrote the above but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics guess what those are not the people that will make any lasting peace in the region more deleted stuff exactly you are right i guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment is full with men like joseph weitz we and our either refers to zionists or jews i donot know which well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem i think that is fair enough no that is not an answer since i asked for a system that could solve the problem you said any could be used then you provided a contradiction above you wrote that you understood what i meant underlined by any system can be used to solve the conflict but not any system would resolve it justly guess where that takes your logic to nevernever land you are proving yourself as a first you understood what i meant but then you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic too bad for you the master of wisdom the greatest problem of zionism is arab children rabbi shoham oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are a real bummer when i try giving your posts any credit why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in if you were a zionists if you believe in zionist codes and acts well i feel sorry for you because the same rabbi shoham had said yes zionism is racism if you feel ashamed and bothered by the zionist codes then drop zionism if you are not zionist why are you bothered then you should join me in condemning these racist zionist codes and acts hasan jonas flygare\",\n",

solution for gaza final solution for the gaza ghetto while israeli jews fete the uprising of the warsaw ghetto they repress by violent means the uprising of the gaza ghetto and attempt to starve the gazans your comparison with the warsaw ghetto uprising is insulting and racist beyond belief the attempts to quiet any violence in the gaza strip are just that the efforts to quell murder and mayhem in the gaza strip were the resluts of violence and came after the violence it was not an arbitrary racial move like the nazi treatment of jews jews had not committed acts of violence and murder as have the residents of gaza i find your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than antiisrael bigotry the gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world has been cut off from the world for weeks the israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of gaza some NUM people by denying them the right to leave the strip and seek work in israel it is not punishment but protection from repeated attacks by residents of gaza you selfservingly omit any references to why israel has had to take action apparaently the deaths of innocent israeli civilians do not enter into your equation a racist ommission on your part while polish nonjews risked their lives to save jews from the ghetto no israeli jew is known to have risked his life to help the gazan resistance the only help given to gazans by israeli jews only dozens of people is humanitarian assistance the right of the gazan population to resist occupation is recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of justice a population denied basic human rights is entitled to rise up against its tormentors the right of israel to protect its citizens from murderers is also recognized by international law israeli civilians have been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis if this wave of murder does not matter to you then your posturing for the basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing but an antiisrael charade as is known the israeli regime is considering gazans unworthy of israeli citizenship and equal rights in israel although they are considered worthy to do the dirty work in israeli hotels shops and fields do you know of residents of gaza who have applied for israeli citizenship and were denied i have heard of no such denials taking place can you document this or is this more of your stupid and innacurate propaganda the truth is that if gazan residents applied for citizenship hamas would murder them as collaborators many gazans are born in towns and villages located in israel they may not live there for these areas are reserved for the master race how dare you use such a disgusting phrase how very easy you attack a people when you omit facts which fly in the face of your pure racism perhaps you are judging a people to be the racists that you are do you believe that all jews must have the same bigoted makeup as you here's another little fly in your ointment about the 'master race' for you to avoid two months ago a plane with NUM bosnian muslims left bosnia to seek asylum in the middle east four arab nations refused to grant them asylum then when israli arabs agreed to take the responsibility for them they were allowed into israel yes israel but when the plane landed the israeli arabs who had previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved with the rescue project because they felt that it would make israel look good it was more important to avoid any good pr for israel than to take care of fellow muslims israel moved them to a kibbutz where they are safe and secure the truth is that time after time the islamic world has turned its back on muslims in need more than israel has even in the case of the NUM deportees lebanon was willing to let their socalled arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary in lebanon nearly twice as many palestinians have been murdered by other palestinians than in confrontations with israel hundreds of thousands of palestinians had been deported from kuwait just because they were palestinian the truth is that your phoney concern for the welfare of the palestinians is nothing but an excuse to attack israel you are part of the ignorant effort to confine all concern for the welfare of the palestinians to attacking israel but the truth is there are greater reasons than israel for the plight of the palestinians to disregard jordan or kuwait or saudi arabia or any of the other oilrich nations who do nothing for these people is to use the plight of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of jews or your hatred of israel antisemitism and antizionism is not the same as propalestinian and anyone who insists that it is the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare the nazi regime accorded to the residents of the warsaw ghetto the right to self administration they selected jews to pacify the occupied population and preventing any form of resistance some jewish collaborators were killed israel also wishes to rule over gaza through arab collaborators your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your racism cannot be disguised jews had never declared war on a polish people jews had never attacked poles with knives or had used the ghetto as a staging ground for attacks to take something like the warsaw ghettothe creation of which you do not even bother to discussand the uprising that followed is to degrade the dead and to show that intelligent debate on a difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview you clearly have never even read a single word of the covenant of the islamic resistance movement here is arguably the single most antisemitic genocidal document since mein kampf yet it is totally disregarded in your rantings your racism is most evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation if it were considered you might actually have to deal with mideast problems in a balanced manner rather than in an antisemitic manner as israel denies gazans the only two options which are compatible with basic human rights and international law that of becoming israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for selfdetermination it must be concluded that the israeli jewish society does not consider gazans full human beings and just how was gaza obtained do you forget that israel is not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it but had taken gaza in a war that it did not start did you know land israel captures in wars wars which other nations have always started aren't the same as israel and they are subject to a completely different set of international laws since you do continuously refer to international law would you please say what specific international laws israel is violating this attitude is consistent with the attitude of the nazis towards jews i can cite NUM reasons why it is not the current policies by the israeli government of cutting off gaza are consistent with the wish publicly expressed by prime mininister yitzhak rabin that 'gaza sink into the sea' where is this quote i have never heard rabin assert that he wished such a thing since you are in general a liar you'll have to provide the entire quote with source or this effort will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications one is led to ask oneself whether israeli leaders entertain still more sinister goals towards the gazans whether they have some final solution up their sleeve only you are led to ask such a loaded racist intellectually dishonest question you inability to come to terms with what you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order i urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever they can to help the gazans regain their full human civil and political rights to which they are entitled as human beings why do you not feel the same compassion for the jews of iran or iraq or yemen or saudi arabia or syria do you have an inkling of what they have endured over the past decades or what about the plight of the palestinians in kuwait or what about the treatment of the bosnian muslims do you think the residents of gaza are being subjected to what all the muslims in bosnia are enduring why are you indifferent to the death and suffering of people why do you not care that these folk are being exterminated why do you not care that only israel has given any of these people safe haven could it be due to the fact that it is not israel who is doing the killing the people in gaza are not being exterminated they aren't being killed they aren't being raped they aren't being starved they aren't being driven from their lands they are not kept from receiving food or other supplies but the bosnians are and the only country which has provided some sanctuary to the bosnian muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your life to attacking in the guise of compassion your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself what your real motives are do not flatter yourself into the belief that truth or compassion are what drives you in your case it is clear that hate beats out love every time maybe you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born a jew it is obvious that your hatred of your own judaism is being dumped on all other jews why else would you suggest a racist idea like breeding jews out of existence maybe these fits of antisemitism are a result of being cut off from your own people for an extended period whatever the case may be it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to appear to be when you

military aspect there is a moral aspect to the story of dir yassin at that village whose name was publicized throughout the world both sides suffered heavy casualties we had four killed and nearly forty wounded the number of casualties was nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers the arab troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy the fighting the word troops is unjustified there has never been any evidence that there were any regular or irregular arab forces in the village apart from the villagers defending themselves according to the haganah observer pa'il the irgunlehi forces suffered a lot of casualties because they were incompetent soldiers when they ran into trouble securing the central part of the village a small group of palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty begin's failure to even mention the palmach is only one of the major inaccuracies to use a kind word in his account incidentally three times as heavy may be correct as there is serious evidence that the arab loss was closer to NUM lives than to the oftquoted NUM lives however note that begin compares wounded jews to dead arabs he fails to mention the number of wounded arabs guess why was thus very severe yet the hostile propaganda disseminated throughout the world deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian population of dir yassin was actually given a warning by us before the battle began one of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in arabic all women children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the slopes of the hill by giving this humane warning our fighters threw away the element of complete surprise and thus increased their own risk in the ensuing battle as is thoroughly established by many sources the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch too far from the village for it to provide a usueful warning a substantial number of the inhabitants obeyed the warning and they were unhurt a few did not leave their stone houses perhaps because of the confusion the fire of the enemy was murderous to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent testimony our men were compelled to fight for every house to overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades and the civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable casualties the education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war we never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us in accordance with the accepted custom of war to apply reprisals i am convinced too that our officers and men wished to avoid a single unnecessary casualty in the dir yassin battle but those who throw stones of denunciation at the conquerors of dir yassin NUM would do well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy NUM in connection with the capture of dir yassin the jewish agency found it necessary to send a letter of apology to abdullah whom mr ben gurion at a moment of great political emotion called 'the wise ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country' the 'wise ruler' whose mercenary forces demolished gush etzion and flung the bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey replied with feudal superciliousness he rejected the apology and replied that the jews were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of 'dissidents' throughout the arab world and the world at large a wave of lying propaganda was let loose about 'jewish attrocities' the enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name in the result it helped us panic overwhelmed the arabs of eretz israel kolonia village which had previously repulsed every attack of the haganah was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting beitiksa was also evacuated these two places overlooked the main road and their fall together with the capture of kastel by the haganah made it possible to keep open

nicknamed flying crocodiles for their armour our party was in the second crocodile the civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings the attack helicopters were there to give covering fire if necessary the operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the soviet armed forces because our pilot was a russian officer an

NUM sorry guys for this long article but in fact it is mostly quotings in article flax93apr6125933frejteknikumuuse flaxfrejteknikumuuse jonas flygare writes when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on the ground of occupied territories no i am not neglecting that i'm merely asking you whether the existance of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right to live a as you so eloquently put it human right we can get back to the question of which law should be used in the territories later also you have not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens in the wb revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation of the wb revoke the right of life for somemost its citizens basically revokes the right of for its military men clearly occupation is an undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate ok let me rephrase the question i have repeatedly asked you if the israelis have less human rights than the palestinians well if you just waited for NUM more lines you would have read my statement secondly surely israeli have human rights but and if so why because they belong to the human race or do you disagree on that too from your posting where you did not directly adress my question i inferred that you thought so together with the above statement i then assumed that the reason was the actions of the state of israel re your statement of occupation i'd like you to define the term so i don't have to repeat this 'drag the answer out of hasan' procedure more than neccesary secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment to protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing palestinean human rights i'm sorry but the above sentence does not make sense please rephrase it i donot know about you but it makes full sense to me israelis are being killed because israel is occupying let israel withdraw and israeli blood will be saved it isnot the palestineans who undermined the right of life of israelis but it is israel which occupied and exposed the life of its citizens to the the unconcluded war of NUM more generally the violence in the occupied terretories is part of the intifada and i had previously posted a long article about this issue whom i finished by an open question suppose the intifada stops what is the motive for israel to withdraw donot tell hope for peace and this bullshit everybody in the world looks and hopes for peace so why isnot there any hope of peace is necessary but not sufficient motive if a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions then tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all because not all states are like israelas oppressiveas ignorantor as tyrant oh ok so how about the human rights of the syrians iraqis and others does the name of hama sound familiar or how about the kurds in iraq and turkey how about the same in sweden ok maybe a bit farfetched the russians in the baltic states or the moslem in the old ussr and yugoslavia do the serbs have any human rights remainaing according to you as for the arabian countries their problems are an arabian concern the arabian people can deal with it themselves if the west doesnot intervene as for serbs i donot think that those fucked up rapists excuse my language but it really hurts as much if i was in bosnia itself arenot humans those surely came from outer space or something no human can allow himself to see such attrocities than to participate in and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem the question is not which system would solve the me problem why because any system can solve it the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine i asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for all people involved i assumed that was obvious but i won't repeat that mistake now that i have straightened that out i'm eagerly awaiting your reply so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph no i'm agreeing that to just kick all the palestinians out of israel proper would probably lead to disaster for both parties if that's what you refer to as the 'israeli solution' then so be it ok joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization said it best when writing in his diary in NUM between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country the only solution is a palestine at least western palestine west of the jordan river without arabs and there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be left only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the millions of our own brethren there is no other way out davar NUM september NUM courtesy of marc afifi just a question if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas charter that's the english translations if you have other information i'd be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to a private paper even older i'm not going to get into the question if he wrote the above but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics guess what those are not the people that will make any lasting peace in the region more deleted stuff exactly you are right i guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment is full with men like joseph weitz oh have you met with them personally to read their diaries fascinating what do you do for a living we and our either refers to zionists or jews i donot know which well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem i think that is fair enough no that is not an answer since i asked for a system that could solve the problem you said any could be used then you provided a contradiction above you wrote that you understood what i meant underlined by any system can be used to solve the conflict but not any system would resolve it justly an unjust solution would be a nonsolution per definition no my definition is the same as yours but one has to look into the world politics in politics a solution doesnot imply just solution you said the following for all a it holds that a have property b there exists an a such that property b does not hold thus either or both statements must be false guess where that takes your logic to nevernever land you are proving yourself as a first you understood what i meant but then you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic too bad for you the master of wisdom i was merely pointing out a not so small flaw in your reasoning since you claim to be logical i felt it best to point this out before you started using your statements to prove a point or so am i then to assume you are not logical it seems that it was problem in the definition of solution i think a solution must be just because otherwise it would never be lasting however when politicians say a solution they donot mean a just solution but just a solution the greatest problem of zionism is arab children rabbi shoham oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are a real bummer when i try giving your posts any credit why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in if you were a zionists if you believe in zionist codes and acts well i feel sorry for you because the same rabbi shoham had said yes zionism is racism if you feel ashamed and bothered by the zionist codes then drop zionism if you are not zionist why are you bothered then you should join me in condemning these racist zionist codes and acts any quote can be misused especially when used to stereotype all individuals by a statement of an individual if you use the same methods that you credit 'zionists' with then where does that place you oh by the way i'd advice you not to assume anything about my 'loyalties' i will and am condemning acts i find vile and inhuman but i'll try as long as i can not to assume those acts are by a whole people by zionist above do you mean the state of israel the government of israel the leaders of israel political andor religious or the jews in general if you feel the need to condemn condemn those responsible instead how would you feel if we started condemning you personally based on the bombings in egypt jonas flygare hasan\",\n",

city party committee but they were silent there's no conversation whatsoever and we couldn't figure out what was going on that is we knew it was about karabagh but what it was exactly what they were talking about if someone gave a speech or not we didn't know we bought our tickets there were NUM or NUM people in the theater this was a very small number for that large movie theater the film started about NUM minutes later they stopped the film a crowd burst in about NUM people they came up onto the stage well mostly they were young people from NUM to NUM years old they demanded that an armenian woman come up onto the stage they used foul language and said that they were going to show what azerbaijanis were capable of what they could do to armenian girls i thought that's what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically marina and i were sitting together i told her to move over there were some russian girls sitting nearby so that if someone recognized me or if something happened they would take me and not marina it got quiet NUM or NUM girls jumped up to run out but the door was closedit's only opened at the end of the showand they returned to their seats everyone in the theater was looking at one another russians azerbaijanis people of various nationalities but no one reacted at all no one in the auditorium made a sound they were silent looking at one another and gradually started to leave some guy a really fat one says ok we've scared them enough let's leave they leave slowly pompously it seemed to me that those people were not themselves either they had smoked a bunch of anasha or had taken something else because they all looked beastly like they were ready to tear anyone apart then it was all over as though nothing had happened at all the film started up again it was one of those cheerful films which should have only brought pleasure made you happy to be alive we could barely sit to the end so it had started at seven it was over by nine and it was dark marina and i were walking home lenin street that's the center of town lenin street was packed just packed with young people they were shouting something about karabagh and something about armenians we weren't especially listening because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to make it home or not and just what had happened anyway public transportation wasn't running incidentally when we came out of the theater we saw police policemen standing there the director of the movie theater was looking at the doors because when they were leaving they had broken the glass the doors there are basically all glass everything was broken he stood there grief stricken but looking as though nothing really big had happened like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident with a slingshot well since he looked more or less calm i decided that nothing all that super serious had happened we went out very slowly we wanted to catch a bus we live literally one stop away we didn't want to go on foot not because it was dark but because something might happen we flagged down a cab but the driver didn't want to take us we told him we live near the bus station and he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther i said well ok so we got into the cab and managed to get there something incredible was happening at the bus station there was a traffic jam public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting karabagh they're not going to give up karabagh i go home and tell my family what's going on and there's immediate panic in the house mamma says what should we do like the end had come they were going to come kill us that's it somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up nothing that bad could happen where are we living anyway just what kind of social order do we have somehow we manage to calm mamma down and we went to bed but no one could sleep everyone made as though nothing had happened that was on saturday in short the day went by we didn't go anywhere and didn't call our relatives no one did anything because life goes on that day i realized something was approaching but what exactly i couldn't guess on the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be we lived like we always had there were five of us at home mamma papa and us three sisters lyuda marina and i my sister lyuda was in yerevan at the time we sat at home and no one went out later we learned that a demonstration had started that morning it all started they were smashing up stores we were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it then a girlfriend of mine lyuda zimogliad came by at around three o'clock i think we worked together we did our apprenticeships together she's a russian girl she said that something awful was happening in town i asked don't they want armenians well what are they after if they're already in that state she says no nothing like that it's just a demonstration but it's awful to watch it somehow it feels like a war has broken out public transportation has been stopped the cabs the buses well it's just a nightmare then papa decides to go to the drugstore my mother was having allergy problems at the time he left the house and our neighbor aunt vera asked him where are you going stop there are such terrible things going on in the courtyard aren't you afraid to go out papa didn't know what she was talking about she simply pushed him back into the entryway he came home and told mamma mamma said well if aunt vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on but we didn't go see her she's a russian she lives across from us i had to see my friend out around five o'clock i tell lyuda ok look it's time for you to go it's late already i'll see you out mamma says you don't need to go it's too late already you can see what the situation in town is so we decided to stay home dinner was ready mamma says let her eat with us then she can go we sat down at the table but no one was hungry no one was in the mood we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down and make it appear that we're eating we turned on the television and the show in fairytale land was coming on we cleared the table we hear some noise out in the courtyard i go out on the balcony but i can't see what's going on because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station and there is a 9story building in the way there is mob of people i can't figure out what's happening they're shouting something looking somewhere i can't make out what is going on i go down to a neighbor she's an azerbaijani we've been friends of her family for about NUM years i go down to look from their place i see people shouting looking at the 5and 9story buildings near the bus station just then soldiers set upon them about NUM people with clubs the mob runs off in different directions i even see several people from our building they are looking and laughing i decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing it means they're not killing anyone but now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers one of the soldiers cannot manage to get away they start stomping on him with their feet everyone's kicking him i become ill and go home and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there can't speak well they've probably killed that soldier the way that crowd is if each of them kicked him just once they took his club away from him and started to beat him with it but it was far away and i couldn't see if he got up and left or not i become terrified and go home and say lyuda don't go anywhere stay at our place because if you go out they could kill you or then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12story building and starts shouting something we go out onto the balcony all of our neighbors are also out on theirs too everyone is standing staring the mob is shouting and about NUM minutes later comes running toward our building as it turns out at the 12story building the azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming in there's only one entryway there they could stop them they all run up to our building mamma immediately starts closing the windows afraid that they might throw stones they have stones and they break the windows all of them there are very many people we have a large courtyard and it's packed with people they spill up to the first floor so they don't crush each other they crawl up on trees posts and garages it's just a huge cloud of people they break and burn the motorcycle of the armenian sergey sargisian from our building we close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our entryway they come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar it's incomprehensible mamma told me later that they were shouting father's name grisha open the door we've come to kill you or something like that i don't remember that i was spaced out kind of mamma says into the bedroom quickly in the bedroom we have two tall beds part of our dowry mamma says hide there they probably won't come in there they'll ask something say something and leave she says we'll tell them that we live alone here i can't imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts i go to them and say that i'll stand together with them i'll talk with them if they come maybe i can find a common language with them all the more so if they know me i speak azerbaijani more or less and i can find out what they want i told marina and lyuda to hide under the bed and my sister lyuda i can't remember if i told her anything or not then they open the door it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall the crows bursts in and starts to shout get out of here leave vacate the apartment and go back to your armenia things like that i tell them what has happened speak calmly one of you tell me calmly what has happened in azerbaijani they say get out of the apartment leave i say ok go downstairs we'll gather everything we need and leave the apartment i realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them these are animals they must be stopped the ones standing in the doorway the young guys say there are old people and one girl with them too bad they take two or three steps back it seems as though i have pacified them with our exchange then someone in the courtyard shouts commanding them don't you understand what you are saying kill them and that was it that was all it took they grab papa carry him into one room and mamma and me into another they put mamma on the bed and start undressing her beating her legs they start tearing my clothes right there in front of mamma i don't remember where they went what they did or how much time passed i had the feeling that they beat me on the head on my body and tore my clothes all at the same time i don't even know what i said the atrocities started

says well we're done here they are beating mamma on the head they break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs she loses consciousness and they decide that she's dead papa was out cold they want to throw lyuda off the balcony but they can't get the window open apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows can't be opened they leave her next to the window she was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed out she's not a real strong person anyway he looks at me and sees that i'm saying something that i'm still twitching well i start saying the opposite of what i should be which is humbling myself and pleading i start shouting cursing they don't get any entreaty out of me i already know that i'm dead why would i humble myself before anyone and he says that if that's what i think since my tongue is so long maybe he thinks that i still look quite appealing in short he commands that i be taken outside i no longer saw or remembered what was happening to marina and lyuda i don't know if they are alive or not they take me outside they are dragging me by my arms by my legs they are hitting me against the wall the railings something metal while they are carrying me someone is biting me someone else is pinching me i don't even know i think my god when will death come if only it were sooner then they carry me out throw me near the entryway and start kicking me i lose consciousness what happened after that how many people there were i don't remember i come to after a while i don't remember how long a neighbor is bringing me clothing i'm entirely covered with blood she puts a dress on me i remember that i said the same words over and over again mamma what happened mamma what have they done to us where are we whose house are we at i can't make sense out of anything there is a guy standing over me i sort of know him he served in afghanistan his name is igor he brought me indoors when they all went to the third entryway and killed a person there igor gathered his courage took me into his arms and brought me to the neighbors' even though he's smallminded he put himself at risk igor agayev is azerbaijani he served in afghanistan there are three brothers the older brother also served there i think now he's stationed here on the border in armenia igor brought me to the neighbors' and then helped me come to my senses saying karina i know you calm down i'm not one of them how do i know who's who and what's what i come to and they clean me up i was covered in blood then papa i saw papa i saw mamma and marina too igor was there when they dragged marina and lyuda out from under the bed marina lyuda said that she was russian they said we'll let you go we aren't touching the russians go and while they are dragging marina out she decides she's going to tell them she's azerbaijani igor immediately grabs marina's and lyuda's hands because he knows marina and knows that she is armenian and is our sister and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding on the door so she will open up she opens the door and igor pushes them in there so they survived my sister lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things while they were going downstairs taking things downstairs then coming back up again lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed there then when she was herself again she found a torn night shirt and put it on and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor the one whose apartment i had watched the crowd from the friend of ours and knocked on the door the neighbor opened and said i'm not going to let you in the apartment because i'm afraid of them but i'll give you some stockings and we'll leave the building lyuda says i'll stay at your place because of what's going on they keep going up and down the stairs it was just for a moment just a moment in life but the neighbor wouldn't consent lyuda came back to our place and lay under the bed i came to mother was there i can't remember my supervisor's telephone number but something had to be done somehow i remembered and called and he came to get us he didn't have any idea what was going on he thought we were simply afraid he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death he came and got us and took us to the police precinct there they looked us over i was having trouble walking my lungs hurt badly it was hard to breathe my supervisor's name is urshan feyruzovich mamedov he's the head of our administration they took us there when we were leaving i saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town the buses were ordinary passenger buses there were very many soldiers we left around eleven right after eleven if these people could stop what was happening they could save a great many lives because the crowd was moving on toward the school and what was going on there i think everyone know not only in sumgait not only in yerevan because there they murdered them all one after the next without stopping after us i think NUM people died in microdistrict no NUM and NUM to NUM of them were from buildings NUM NUM and NUM in our building one person died and one old woman died from building NUM that's the building in front of ours there young azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building incidentally when we were at the neighbors' marina called our relatives to warn them so they would all know what was happening i called a aunt in microdistrict no NUM they have three neighbors who are armenians i said run quickly i can't explain what's going on hide do what you can just stay alive hide at azerbaijanis' ones who won't give you away at that moment three people came in policemen i think they were azerbaijanis i was in such awful condition my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up there was blood my eye was swollen no one thought i would ever see anything out of that eye again my forehead was badly cut and onehalf of my face was pushed out forward no one would have thought that i would survive get my normal appearance back and be able to grasp anything at all i started to scream at those people why did you come who sent you here no one wants you here haven't you killed people people yet what are you doing here one of the soldiers said don't scream at us we're muslims but we're not from the sumgait police they called in from daghestan so at that point the daghestan police were there when we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there there were soldiers police with dogs ambulances firemen i don't know maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police precinct i don't know what they were there for there were also doctors from baku there they examined lyuda and me and said these women need to go to the maternity home but we don't know what to do with the rest so they took us and i lost contact with my parents my boss everyone my boss said don't worry i'll find you no matter where you are no matter what happens we went to the hospital there we were examined by a department head from the sumgait maternity home pashayeva i think her name was she examined us the ambulance was from baku i figured out that the sumgait ambulances hadn't done anything they didn't respond to any calls people called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life that doctor looked me over and i could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened for she became quite glad i even thought to myself god can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong she looks me over and says now why are you suffering so you don't know what your people have been doing your people did even worse things and i think great i have to deal with her and i felt so bad i thought why don't i just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her here i am in this condition and being told about something that our people did i just didn't have the energy to say how could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours haven't already done i stayed there then they brought in another woman ira b she was married and she was raped in her own apartment too there were three of us ira lyuda and NUM the next morning they took lyuda and ira away they didn't do anything to help us this was in the old maternity home in the combined block they didn't do anything more than examine me that was it i didn't want any shots or tranquilizer nothing what shots could have calmed me down i didn't even want to look at them i lay in the ward either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur pose but i was alone i was alone even though the wards were packed that same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me that my face was disfigured she asked what had happened to me and i said better to ask your brother what happened there's no point in asking me your brother can better explain what happened she fell into a faint all the doctors threw themselves at her and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward then people from work came to see me my boss his daughter they brought me clothing because i was literally naked the only thing i had on was a dress but the woman who gave it to me was very short and the dress was way up above my knees and the woman orderly said i can't believe you put on such a short dress who are you showing off your legs to here i went back to my ward thinking just one more thing from something people from work came and brought me something in a sack apples i think three or four pounds but i couldn't take them i had become so weak that it was just embarrassing i said that i couldn't take the apples and really didn't have any appetite no one had to bring me anything some woman took the sack and oh yes then i heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that i was an armenian maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me so they must have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack that something else would happen that it would be worse or perhaps someone was outside on the street i don't know in any case i didn't sleep a wink that night the next morning they picked me up a whole police detail put me in a bus and off we went i didn't even know where they were taking me they took me to the club where the troops were the very one i was in that illfated evening i got off the bus near the city party committee there were a great many troops tanks armored personnel carriers the whole scene was terrible i saw a few people i knew there and that calmed me a little i had already thought that i was the only one left so there were five or six of us left in sumgait after that night i still didn't know what happened to my parents they didn't come to see me in the hospital and my boss told me that everything was fine i didn't know whether to believe him or not maybe he was just trying to calm me down maybe something happened on the way then i went to the club and saw a lot of people i knew they all knew one another they were all kissing each other and asking what happened what went on two days later they came to see me from work they were there all the time each day they came showed interest and were constantly bringing me money they did everything they could of course i'm most thankful to my boss the only one of my colleagues who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions neither before nor after nor in the heat of the moment no matter what happened he constantly took an interest a sincere interest from the heart then about two days later the secretary of the party committee came not from our party organization but from the first trust which ours is part of comrade kerimov a very important figure in our town he made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away because if i sat down by myself i couldn't get up or lie down again there was something wrong with my lungs it was hard to breathe they examined me there several times there i lay were several doctors they all thought that that it must just be from all the blows i don't know they didn't diagnose anything in particular when i was in the maternity home i even asked i made it a point of insisting that they take me to the trauma section because i felt so awful there was no way something inside wasn't broken my ribs well they took me there and took xrays and said that everything was fine there were emergency medical workers on duty in the club the mother of one of marina's friends was there she was the head doctor at the sumgait children's clinic they had every kind of antifever agent in the world which was exactly what i needed at that moment i thought i said that i was having great difficulty breathing i couldn't seem to get enough air something was wrong with me they put tight bandages around my chest and waist later i overheard some people saying that i had been cut all over i think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut but i wasn't cut they took us to the khimik boarding house we lived there a long time soon appeared representatives they were agitating at first people would not talk to them and drove them off one of the armenian women shouted we demand that seidov come the response was it's seidov who sent us seidov is the chairman of the azerbaijani council of ministers the woman said we'll only see seidov's daughter have her come here we'll do the same things to her that they did to our daughters and then we'll deal with you agitators and so on more of them said have seidov himself come this went on day in day out the agitators kept coming and coming this drove us out of our wits then people gradually started departing for yerevan because they realized it was senseless to stay everything got on our nerves the smell the small children there were children at the sk club children who had literally just come out of the maternity home what were they doing in a club that didn't even have running water all the time at first we had to pay to eat there they even overcharged us as it turned out on the second day someone told us that they would bring us food for free the children were ill everything stank there well imagine about NUM people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than NUM you couldn't sit or lie down it was impossible to even move the stench was awful even the smallest infants took ill overnight there i heard that they were arriving seriously ill in yerevan the infants they have to be washed they have to be bathed not to mention that we the adults were ill and needed care people were fainting right and left i just don't know everyone was crying everyone only the young people the men somehow managed to keep it together but the women were in a constant state of panic it seemed to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab it seemed clear that we had been gathered together purposely like during the war so that they could burn the movie theater and there wouldn't be a single armenian left then people went up to the attic i didn't see them i only heard them because i was lying down and couldn't get up i lay right on the stage we had some room there apparently they caught two people with either oil or gas i think they wanted to burn the theater maybe someone saw them i didn't i was in no condition to open my eyes everyone was suspicious of everyone else they would ask aren't you an azerbaijani i think i saw you somewhere i think you're an azerbaijani they led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports relatives might be covering for each other half of the people did not have any documents there were people who had run out of their homes in nothing but a pair of pants and slippers or wearing just a shirt not like they should have with their ids so on the 28th on sunday i think the police did nothing to help us on monday everything resumed where it had left off on block 41a they didn't spare a soul there not children not pregnant women nobody they killed they burned they hacked with axes just everything possible they murdered the melkumian family whom i knew my mother worked with them their daughter inlaw went to school with my older sister they were brutally murdered only the two daughtersinlaw survived by a miracle one was able to save herself she ran away the neighbors wouldn't take her in so she ran about the building until she found refuge she was pregnant and had two small children this all continued on monday in block 41a on the 29th when the troops were already in the city they murdered people they overturned automobiles and they burned entire families they say they didn't even know for sure if the people were armenians or not i heard that the lezgins suffered too i'm not sure myself i didn't see any lezgins who had been injured they burned cars so it's very difficult now to say exactly who died and who didn't it was very difficult to identify the corpses or rather what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned it's all very hard to imagine of course i heard that many people disappeared without a trace from the btz plant two people including a woman who worked the night shift aunt razmella who also lived in microdistrict NUM they were stopping buses between baku and sumgait in the evening people who had been visiting baku were returning to sumgait and people from baku were going home from sumgait and there were students too they were simply savagely murdered they were stopping the buses the drivers immediately did what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people they stopped the buses dragged the armenians out and killed them on the spot i didn't see it myself but i heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them later it was hard to discern from the corpses well you can't call them corpses you had to figure out from the ashes who it was l heard that two fellows saved two women one a student ira g if i'm not mistaken she was in the hospital a long time after that and she still can't figure out who saved her she was also brutally raped and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses the fellow pulled her out of that whole pile of corpses put his coat on her took her into his arms and carried her to the city i still can't imagine how he managed to do that i heard that from engels grigorian he knows her apparently well a lot of people went to that hospital anyway she was in the hospital and singing a song in armenian and they wrote the words down and i think he still has that piece of paper because he says that a lot of people now have that song the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape they couldn't find the guy who saved her he left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance she was in such awful shape that probably like me she couldn't remember anyone's face i think that i knew one of the people who broke into our house maybe i had talked with him once but i received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head i can't remember to this day who he was then it seems i saw the secretary of the directorate's party organization where marina works she goes to school and works she goes to night school at azi and works by day at the khimzashchita construction and installation administration i'm the secretary of the komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretaries of party and komsomol organizations we had joint meetings i know them all i've even talked with them and he i know is from armenia an azerbaijani but from armenia it became obvious that many of those people were azerbaijanis born in armenia they took me to various police stations to the police precinct and to the procuracy because the ussr procuracy got involved in the case and i iden tified the photographs of people who i could more or less recognize they showed me the people who were in our apartment they're working on our case but i can't even recognize them although it was proved that they were the ones they're processing it somehow they tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were dragging me there was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch me he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that all these people all of them as much as i've heard about them and seen them they were all from kafan the secretary of the party organization is named najaf najaf rzayev he was there when everything started it must have been him because i didn't recognize anyone else in the crowd whom i knew besides him all the more since i told him listen you do something because you know me he turned away and went toward the bedroom where marina was well you couldn't see marina anyway there was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out anyone all of it flew right out of my head and then gradually i became myself again at the city party committee there were military people there i told them what went on and they wrote it all down i told them his name on march NUM the secretary of our first trust party organization the one we're part of came to see us his name is najaf rzayev i tell mamma if he's here despite the fact that i gave his name it means that either his alibi has been confirmed or probably that they think i'm crazy not responsible for my words he said what did they do to you how awful myself i hid an armenian family then after some time goes by he comes back again and says something entirely different i wasn't at home my family and i went to baku i said marina what is he saying he said something totally different before after that i didn't go to see our procurator our case is being handled by a procurator from voronezh fedorov by name fedorov told me that rzayev's case had just gotten to him and there were so names involved what are they doing with rzayev did he prove his alibi or not they just think that since i was hit in the head i can't say anything for sure whether it was him or not it will be an insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it but at the same time i'm afraid to say i'm a hundred percent sure that it was he because no mat ter who i name they tell me no you're wrong he didn't do that that one wasn't there all the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind who did what exactly i can't say when they took me outside there was a whole crowd there but i didn't see it because i had my eyes closed all the time it seemed to me that i always got it because of my eyes people were always hassling me for some reason it always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible when they were beating my face i thought they were trying to put my eyes out so i had my eyes closed they took me outside and started to beat me a young guy NUM held my arms he works at the btz plant and right nearby across the road from us block NUM is where all this was going on right across the road from us the btz dormitory is over there that's where he lives now he's in custody they even have proved as far as i know that it was he who killed shurik gambarian the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building one person in our building was killed it was that man a guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me he saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me but he didn't come over he just looked and then went into the dormitory a while after it was all over people started making announcements in town saying that investigators had been summoned that guy went and told them everything now they've caught him everything's been proved now evidently they've been beating him i don't know what they're doing with them over there but he himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant some young guy came to the plant and said everyone who wants to kill armenians come to the bus station on saturday at ten that was it he said the ones who wanted to went this was at the btz plant during the night shift probably late friday night it was at night they were at the sauna together and he said what do you mean do you understand what you are saying the others were silent probably in their hearts they were thinking i'm going to go but they didn't say anything to one another he said that he thought it important to to go because he had heard a lot about what had happened in kafan that they had killed their azerbaijani sisters their mothers burned villages and all of that that guy was also born in kafan that is certain and marina says that the secretary of the party organization is from armenia too from i've participated in the investigation a couple of times i'm satisfied with them thus far they summoned us and asked about what happened and every word i said was recorded i met some guy there by the way he was an armenian i said that he was in our apartment but what he did i don't know his last name was grigorian eduard grigorian he s from sumgait from microdistrict NUM he was sentenced i think to five years not his first time his mother is russian i met with him at the kgb in baku at the azerbaijani kgb they took us there and showed me photographs there were so many photographs i think they even photographed those people who were caught at curfew and i've got them all confused i say the face was about like this the guy in the white coat with the red clasps but he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere and it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack well this guy grigorian i said he was in our apartment but he is so lightcomplected that he looks like a lezgin i don't know what he did i can't remember maybe he beat me or raped me but he was in our apartment at the kgb he started asking me pleading with me there's no need for this all this stuff look me in the eyes you're like a sister to me i took a look at him and thought my god heaven forbid that i should have a brother like you but they were satisfied with my responses because i said everything without great certainty i was there with mamma then lyuda came in but when she came in she got sick immediately she wanted to kill him she crawled over the table at him she recognized him when she came to lyuda was lying on the balcony the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom we had all kinds of boxes with dishes in them the dowries for all three sisters they stole everything in the apartment leaving only small things at that moment lyuda came to and started remembering everything well seeing the faces hearing the voices two people were saying they could burn the apartment another says why burn the apartment when i've got three kids and no place to live so this guy was in temporary housing he didn't have anywhere to live he was from sumgait they were sure that they would get the apartment besides the neighbors were azerbaijani why should they burn the apartment they might burn azerbaijanis that's what they said how did they know there were azerbaijanis there if they just picked a place thinking that armenians lived there we have a list of the residents for our part of the building our name is in there but how could they know that azerbaijanis lived on the other side of the wall from us so they didn't set fire to our apartment i don't know i was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when i was outside if someone had asked me what was happening i would have said that a civil war was going on well maybe not civil but probably civil because when they were beating me i opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching like at a free horror film so a civil war was going on and only the armenians were being fought if it were a world war or something like that they would have been fighting everyone but they only fought us then i met some women from our building some azerbaijanis they are crying they tell me karina we saw all of it how could it happen they're asking me well i just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to me i think that if it were the other way around either i wouldn't have been able to take it or i would have tried to avert it like that one azerbaijani woman did in front of our building a woman lives there an awful dissipated woman if you can call her a woman the dissipated life she leads two armenian families live there in her part of the building she came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse she came down to the entryway and said you'll come in this entryway over my dead body so not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway some folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't even know what they were doing i don't think that's true they knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman they couldn't have cared less about her but the fact that she was an azerbaijani stopped them they were just beasts they had smoked so much when they came to our place they were all chewing something i noticed everyone who came into the apartment was chewing something i think my god maybe i just think that maybe i'm losing my mind but no they're all chewing something maybe it is some kind of drug it must be because at first glance they all seemed to be such normal people young cleanshaven looking exactly as if they had come to some sort of celebration but they were shouting something they didn't talk they shouted as though there were deaf people there they screamed and screamed yeah killing killing we're killing the armenians only they didn't shout kill they shouted gurun ermianlary gurun literally means kill or destroy that's how it was i'll continue we hid in a captain's apartment he's an azerbaijani his wife is a tatar we were sitting in their apartment their kids were out in the yard their kids knew a whole lot this was in our part of the building on the third floor when mamma came to and couldn't find lyuda she took papa's hand this was while the looters were stealing things but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing mamma found the courage to a boy said to my mother where's the gold mamma said he must have been NUM to NUM years old he even looked russian he was so fairskinned but the azerbaijanis from armenia are fairskinned i noticed they were all on the fair side he shouted they were all smashing things and he asks mamma where the gold is we kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers in a little black bag we kept everything in there mamma doesn't really like to wear gold she probably never even wore those things from the time they were bought for her they took everything that was lying on the cheval glass mamma thinks that the gold saved us because they threw themselves at the gold and mamma grabbed papa who was trying to breathe they had closed his mouth bound his hands and put a pillow and a chair on his face they had shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off he had something in his mouth he was having trouble breathing his nose was filled with blood mamma grabbed him and started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted to open their doors to them mamma said that by accident completely by accident that person opened his door he was sleeping and said halfawake what's happened he sees that they are bloody mamma said at least go and find out what's happening to my daughters even if they've burned them or murdered them at least bring the corpses he went looking for us at that moment lyuda was under the bed she says that after they left it seemed that someone was calling her name when he quietly called her she couldn't get out from under the bed she wanted to get out and was calling softly she thought she was shouting but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to herself it just seemed to her that she was shouting when she got out from under the bed everyone was gone and again she thought that she had lost her mind i'll never leave here never to hell with it it just seems that way to me i'll come to eventually but then when everything had settled down stopped that mall brought lyuda down and igor carried me in from outside or first i was brought in then lyuda i don't remember what order it happened in and mamma said listen they're all running around down there shouting something or other and running toward the other building it had more or less calmed down where we were who's dead who's alive we don't know i tried to call my girlfriend i had basically come to mamma says listen let's go upstairs at least get a mattress or something we don't know how long we'll be here maybe they didn't burn everything i don't get it all women have that feeling they want to get something from their homes maybe not everything was taken i tell mamma mamma what do you need any of that for to hell with it we're alive forget the rest of it all of it she says no let's go get at least something maybe we'll leave here spend the night at someone else's mamma went upstairs and their little boy their son alik was standing on the lookout lie was standing there to see if they were coming they only managed to run up there and grab something one time he shouts come back they're coming they didn't have enough time to get a lot mattresses from one apartment a blanket from another mamma got my knitting someone managed to grab our old things the ones we never wore out of the hall someone took father's old coveralls the neighbor his wife mamma and papa marina went with them i was in no condition to leave neither was lyuda we just sat they ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs they're dragging something again they were going toward the other building maybe over by the school or there was an unfinished building over there people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished building they could gradually carry everything over there then things more or less calmed down i tried to call my boss later there was more noise we were on the third floor in a onebedroom apartment and a woman lives in the onebedroom place on the second floor asya dallakian she's an old woman retired she wasn't at home at that time she was usually in the country she has a married daughter there and her grandson is in the army she is only very rarely in town she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant they started pounding on her door and broke it down she had two or three beds in there something like that she's a 60to 70yearold woman who really does not even live there probably she had some pots a couple of metal bed frames and mattresses and a television when her grandson came she bought a television they started wrecking everything i started getting sick again i think my god what is going on around here when will this end we turned off the lights and sat as it turns out the people who weren't afraid the ones who knew what was going on knew not to turn off the lights we didn't know but they didn't come to where we were all the same they all knew very well that he was a captain he went out and closed the door and we sat in his apartment his last name was kasumov he's an exserviceman retired works up at the fire station at some plant or other he went out and stood at his door they tell him comrade captain don't worry we won't harm you you're one of us he went upstairs and they say aren't you taking anything from this apartment he says i don't need anything and the women who were standing in the yard we have a basement full of water the women who were standing in the yard saw those guys they left everything they stole on the first floor and ran upstairs again the women threw everything they had time to into the basement to save our property some things were

the school he ran off in that direction oh i forgot the most important point when igor picked me up in his arms there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on they just didn't tell me about it for a long time the wife of that military man she didn't want to kill my spirit i was already dead enough later she told me that after they murdered uncle shurik in the third entryway one of them the ringleader apparently a young man said where's the girl who was here and he became furious the woman tells him she came to she didn't know what to say think something up someone carried her off then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family so the woman says she came to and went to the basement now our basement is full of water so the whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse they took flashlights they were up to their waists in water water which had been standing there for years and soot and fuel oil they climbed down in there to get me then one of them said there's so much water down there she probably walked and walked and then passed out and died she met her death in the basement that's it we can leave no problem i didn't know that and when i was told i felt worse two times worse a lot worse so they didn't just want to pound me flat something more awful was awaiting me after that we of course didn't want to live

think you're doing that's all that would have done it there were NUM apartments in our building not one person said it when i was lying on the ground and all those people were standing on their

dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one armenian they would have stood up for one of their own true they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway an old sick woman tried to stop the

up elements i never addressed nor commented on in any way i made no comment on who is right or who is wrong only that civilians are being used as cover and that having been placed in between the israelis and the guerillas they will be injured as both parties continue their fight pardon me tim but i do not see how it can be possible for the idf to fail to detect the presence of those responsible for planting the bomb which killed the three idf troops and then later know the exact number and whereabouts of all of them several villages were shelled how could the idf possibly have known that there were guerrillas in each of the targetted villages you see it was an arbitrary act of retaliation if the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on israel is it not working why is it further neccessary for israeli guns to pound lebanese villages why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone you see there is more to the shelling of the villages it is called retaliation getting backgetting even it doesn't make sense to shell the villages the least it shows is a reckless disregard by the israeli government for the lives of civilians i agree with you here i have always thought that israel's bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid thoughtless inhumane and ineffective but there is no reason that israel should passive wait until attackers chose to act there is every reason to believe that taking the fight to the enemy will do more to stop attacks as i said previously israel spent several decades sitting passively on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks after the attackers had entered israeli territory it didn't work very well the host arab state did littlenothing to try and stop these attacks from its side of the border with israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher as was their physical and psychological impact on the civilians caught in their path the problem tim is that the original reason for the invasion was palestinian attacks on israel not lebanese attacks whatso the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states can start all over again while i also hope for this to happen it will only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their soil they have to prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance towards antiisrael guerillas inresidence if israel is not willing to accept the word of others then imho it has no business wasting others' time coming to the peace talks this is just another selectively applied statement the reason for this drawnout impasse between ababspalestinians and israelis is that neither side is willing to accept the word of the other by your criteria everyone should stay away from the negotiations that is precisely why the palestinians in their recent pisga proposal for the interim period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy are demanding conditions that essentially define autonomy already they do not trust that israel will follow through the entire process and allow palestinians to reach full autonomy do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the palestinians if you do then why should israel's view of arabspalestinians be any different why should they trust the arabpalestinians' words since they don't they are very reluctant to give up tangible assets land control of areas in exchange for words for this reason they are also concerned about the sorts of guarantees they will have that the arabs will follow through on their part of any agreement reached first i believe that my statement applies to both sides having said that i think it is neccessary to separate what is legitimately negotiable and what is not for example no country has the right to abuse one's human rights deciding whether there will be one or two states in palestine is a legitimate question while de facto one state exists israel must treat all within its domain equitably tim you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians in lebanon have been disarmed hezbollah remains the only independent militia hezbollah does not attack israel except at a few times such as when the idf burned up sheikh mosavi his wife and young son while the major armaments those allowing people to wage civil wars have been removed the weapons needed to crossborder attacks still remain to some extent rocket attacks still continue and commando raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life yours of that of others such attacks also continue yes i am afraid that what you say is true but that still does not justify occupying your neighbor's land israel must resolve its disputes with the native palestinians if it wants peace from such attacks of course if israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't make the lebanese so mad as to do that bat guano the situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks were commonplace not true lebanese were not attacking israel in the 1970s with a strong lebanese government free from syrian and israeli interference i believe that the border could be adequately patrolled the palestinian heavy weapons have been siezed in past years and i do not see as significant a threat as once existed please tim don't fall into the trap of treating lebanese and palestinians as all part of the same group there are too many who think all arabs or all muslims are the same too many times i have seen people support the bombing of palestinian camps in retaliation for an idf death at the hands of the lebanese resistance or the shelling of lebanese villages in retaliation for a palestinian attack tim\",\n",

during the first days of the events the 27th and the 28th of february i was away on a business trip on the 10th i had got my crew done the paper work and left for the zhdanov district that's in azerbaijan near the nagorno karabagh region after the 14th rumors started to the effect that in karabagh specifically in stepanakert an uprising had taken place they said uprising in azerbaijani but i don't think it was really an uprising just a demonstration after that the unrest started several armenians living in the zhdanov district were injured how were they injured they were beaten even women it was said that they were at the demonstrations but they live here and went from here to karabagh to demonstrate after that i felt uneasy there were some conversations about armenians among the local population the armenians had done this the armenians had done that right there at the site i was attacked a couple of times by kids well true the guys from my crew wouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives after that i felt really bad i didn't know where to go i up and called home and my children tell me there's unrest everywhere be careful well i had a project going on i told the second secretary of the district party committee what had been going on and said i wanted to take my crew off the site they wouldn't allow it they said nothing's going to happen to you we've entrusted the matter to the police we've warned everyone in the district nothing will happen to you well in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me he knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened this man didn't leave me alone for five minutes he was at work the whole time and afterward he spent the night with us too i sense some disquiet and call home my wife also tells me the situation is very tense be careful we finished the job at the site and i left for sumgait first thing on the morning of the 29th when we left the guys warned me they told me that i shouldn't tell anyone on the way that i was an armenian i took someone else's business travel documents in the name of zardali and hid my own i hid it and my passport in my socks we set out for baku our guys were on the bus they sat behind and i sat up front in baku they had come to me and said that they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case as it turns out they knew what was happening in sumgait i arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of sumgait is closed there is no way to get there that the city is closed off and the buses aren't running buses normally leave baku for sumgait almost every two minutes and suddenlyno buses well we tried to get there via private drivers one man an azerbaijani said let's go find some other way to get there they found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to take us to sumgait he took us there but the others had said i wouldn't go if you gave me a thousand rubles why because they're burning the city and killing the armenians there isn't an armenian left well i got hold of myself so i could still stand up so we squared it away the four of us got in the car and we set off for sumgait on the way the driver says in fact there aren't any armenians left 'they burned them all beat them all and stabbed them well i was silent the whole way20odd milesi was silent the driver asks me how old are you old man he wants to know if i'm being that quiet not saying anything maybe it means i'm an armenian how old are you he asks me i say i'm NUM i'm NUM too but i call you 'old man' i say it depends on god each person's life in this world is different i look much older than my years that's why he called me old man well after that he was silent too we're approaching the city i look and see tanks all around and a cordon before we get to the kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand well he was waving his hand we all start waving our hands i'm sitting there with them i start waving my hand too i realized that this was a sign that meant there were no armenians with us i look at the citythere is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the street you know and there's no traffic well probably i was scared they stopped our car people were standing on the sidewalks they have armature shafts and stones and they stopped us along the way the driver tells us how they know who's an armenian and who's not the armenians usually for example i'm an armenian but i speak their language very well well armenians usually pronounce the azeri word for nut or little nut as pundukh but fundukh is actually correct the pronunciations are different anyone who says pundukh even if they're not armenian they immediately take out and start to slash another one says there was a car there with five people inside it he says they started hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire and they didn't let the people out he says they wouldn't let them get out of the car i only saw the car but the driver says that he saw everything well he often drives from baku to sumgait and back when they stop us we all get out of the car i look and there's a short guy his eyes are gleaming he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one we're azerbaijani' they tell him 'no armenians here he did come up to me when we were pulling our things out and says maybe you're an armenian old man but in azerbaijani i say you should be ashamed of yourself and he left turned and left that was all that happened what was i to do i had to the city was on fire but i had to steal my children out of my own home they stopped us at the entrance to mir street that's where the kavkaz store and three large 12story buildings are that's the beginning of downtown i saw that burned automobile there completely burned only metal remained i couldn't figure out if it was a zhiguli or a zaporozhets later i was told it was a zhiguli and the people in there were completely incinerated nothing remained of them not even any traces that driver had told me about it and i saw the car myself the car was there the skeleton a metallic carcass about NUM to NUM yards from the kavkaz store i see a military transport an armored personnel carrier the hatches are closed and people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it the crowd is and i hear shots not automatic fire it's true but pistol shots several shots there were azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier someone in the crowd was shooting apparently they either wanted to kill the soldiers or get a machine gun or something at that point there was only one armored personnel carrier and all the tanks were outside the city cordoning off sumgait i walked on i see two azerbaijanis going home from the plant i can tell by their gait that they're not bandits they're just people walking home i joined them so in case something happened in case someone came up to us and asked questions either of us would be in a position to answer you see but i avoided the large groups because i'm a local and might be quickly recognized i tried to keep at a distance and walked where there were fewer people well so i walked into microdistrict NUM which is across from our block i can't get into our block but i walked where there were fewer people so as to get around well there i see a tall guy and NUM to NUM people are walking behind him and he's shouting into a megaphone comrades the armenian azerbaijani war has begun the police have megaphones like that so they're talking and walking around the second microdistrict i see that they're coming my way and turn off behind a building i noticed that they walked around the outside buildings and inside the microdistricts there were about NUM or NUM people standing on every corner and at the middles of the buildings and at the edges what they were doing i can't say because i couldn't get up

again territorial expansion by force israel has already annexed areas taken over in the NUM war these areas are not occupied but disputed since there is no legitamate governing body citizenship was given to those residents in annexed areas who wanted citizenship the un defines them as occupied they are recognised as such by every nation on earth excluding one small caribean island israel should keep control of parts of the west bank imho the parts that should be kept are the westernmost mountain ridge which contain few arab towns and many suburbs as well as overlooking the city of tel aviv the eastern mountain ridge should be abandonded this is where most of the arabs live and it is less militarily relevant israel should also maintain a presence in the jordan valley so the adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and a continued military presence that is a completely unsustainable situation because the usa is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the israeli ecconomy any more there is no money for such an occupation if so for those of you who support it why were so many settlers moved into the territories if it is not temporary let's hear it there are a number of reasons for people to move they were not moved but chose to move into disputed areas note that since these moves were made by free willed human beings not settlers i will address two aspects of your question why the government would allow or encourage them to move and second why they did move they were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return of the occupied territories machiavelli described the reasoning in the prince the clear intention was to create a constituency which the likud beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous population the pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the redefinition of much land used in common as public land the assertion that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an excuse when the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories must not be changed no amount of self justifying on the part of likud and hard linner appologists will change the fact that the majority of world governments and all of those that actually have any power have condemned this practice the government had a number of reasons for encouraging people to move across the green line they included security and politics the first reason was security a large jewish presense makes it difficult for terrorists to infiltrate a jewish settlements also act as fortresses in times of war theyu also are a liability we are talking about civilian encampments that would last no more than hours against tanks a second reason was political creating settlements brought the arabs to the negotiation table had the creation of new towns and cities gone on another several years there would be no place left in israel where there was an arab majority there would have been no land left that could be called arab don't fool yourself it was the gulf war that brought the israelis to the negotiating table once their us backers had a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed shamir to negotiate or else if the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the usa would have cut the money supply the fact that there are a hundered thousands jews in place changes the face of any peace settlement and restricts what land can be given away not at all they can chose to live in an arab state or return to israel some of the communites created were religious they built their neighborhoods in areas where there were jews until the riots of the 30's and 40's there are communities like this in hebron gaza and all over there are also communities built near religious sites the existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country to annexe territory not in bosnia not in the west bank the point is there are many reasons people moved over the green line and many reasons the government wanted them to whatever status is negotiated for disputed territories it will not be an all or nothing deal new boundaries will be drawn up by negotiation not be the results of a war unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of NUM there will be no peace araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else the real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty since the palestinians will remain heavily dependent on israel indefinitely it is this that will be the guarantor of peace another factor will be the return of lands confiscated by the israeli state within israel and the dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against nonjews within what is nominaly a secular state the irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the israeli state is going to be forced inot the same position this will mean outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying or using much of the land phill hallambaker\",\n",

rulers to one brought up as most americans have been in the gladstonian and foreignmissionary tradition the condition of the jews in turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every nation in the world would have treated as treasonable one readily reaches the conclusion that the jews in turkey were fortunate he also stated that they armenians traitorously turned turkish cities over to the russian invader that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least a hundred turkish villages and exterminated their population turkey and the holocaust an interview with stanford j shaw history who recently completed two books the jews of the ottoman empire and the turkish republic and turkey and the holocaust turkey's role in rescuing turkish and european jewry from nazi persecution NUM shaw chairs the undergraduate interdepartmental degree program in near eastern studies and has organized the program for the study of ottoman and turkish jewry he is affiliated with the g e von grunebaum center for near eastern studies editor how did you come to write these two books on turkey and european and turkish jews shaw basically i'm an ottoman historian but i'm also jewish i've spent twentyfive years studying ottoman history and as time went along whenever i found materials on the ottoman jews i collected them but i never did anything with them until a couple of years ago when i suddenly realized that NUM was the 500th anniversary of the jews being expelled from spain and coming to turkey then the sephardic temple down on wilshire avenue invited me to give a series of three lectures on ottoman jewry these lectures were greatly appreciated and i became motivated to undertake further research to develop a book the jews of the ottoman empire and the turkish republic this book is quite different from the works of most jewish historians who tend to look at the jews in any country more from the viewpoint of the jews and the jewish community and rely mainly on jewish sources i view my subject as an ottoman historian and i approach the jews of the ottoman empire largely from the point of view of ottoman society using largely ottoman sources after i finished this book and sent it to the press i came across additional documents relating to turkish jews during world war ii in the completed book i had said that turkey had done a good deal to rescue the jews during world war ii but i did not actually have many details then i found a batch of documents in the foreign ministry archive relating to actions taken by turkish diplomats to help the jews before and during the holocaust it was too late to add this new information to the book in press so i decided to write a second book i conducted further research mainly in the archives of the foreign ministry in ankara and the turkish embassy and consulate in paris the result was the second book turkey and the holocaust which details how turkey helped rescue jews from the nazis how exactly did they do this the story takes place over a number of years the book presents the material in three parts first of which deals with the period before the holocaust when the nazis came to power in germany in NUM they immediately started dismissing jews and antinazi germans from universities hospitals scientific institutes and the like turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of reforming its universities and it saw in these jews who were being fired from their positions in germany a good source of new talent to help modernize the turkish universities within three months after the nazis started dismissing these jews turkey arranged to take many of them in they were brought to turkey and were given appointments as professors in the turkish universities as heads of scientific institutes and as medical personnel in hospitals about NUM to NUM major jewish professors came to turkey in the 1930s ernst reuter a german political scientist spent the war years teaching political science in turkey after world war ii he was mayor of berlin during the berlin airlift fritz neimark a major german jewish economist came to turkey and helped establish a modern school of economics in istanbul a man named reichenbach who was rescued from the nazis by turkey and spent the war years in turkey eventually came to ucla where he became a professor of philosophy other german jewish emigres engaged in cultural activities in turkey one such was karl ebert who had been a leading theatrical producer in berlin until he was expelled by the nazis he went to turkey where he organized the turkish national theater and the turkish national opera company in ankara with the help of paul hindemuth so the first section of the book covers this first phase when jews were being persecuted in germany and rescued by turkey oddly enough the german emigres when they were in turkey did not seem to think too badly of germany they regarded themselves more as germans than jews and they did not join in the antinazi activities of the local turkish jewish community i even found letters from the nazi representatives to turkey praising these german jewish refugees for their work in promoting the idea of german culture even though these people had been persecuted by the nazis and rescued by the turks they shared the nazis' feelings of aryan racial superiority over the turks the second part of the book deals with the holocaust which began in NUM when the nazis occupied france in europe at that time and especially in france there were about NUM turkish jews they had migrated to europe for various reasons from about the turn of the century onward most of them had settled in europe during the turkish war for independence after world war i when greece was threatening to overrun turkey the greeks had persecuted the jews throughout the nineteenth century and the jews feared what might happen to them if the greeks took over in turkey many jews fled to france during the 1920s and 1930s many also abandoned their turkish citizenship and became french citizens suddenly the nazis invaded france in NUM and started introducing all sorts of antijewish laws the turkish jews soon found that it was not worth very much to be a french jew but that it was worth a lot to be a turkish jew how so turkey remained neutral through most of world war ii it retained its embassies and consulates in all the nazioccupied countries until it finally entered the war on the side of the allies at the end of NUM during the war therefore turkey was in a position to defend its citizens against antijewish measures and the actions that turkish diplomats took form the second chapter of the book turkish diplomats who were stationed in france in particular intervened to protect jews of turkish citizenship from the nazis for those turkish jews who had retained their turkish citizenship there was generally no problem if they were arrested and sent to a concentration camp the turkish diplomats would communicate with the commanders of the camp and other officials and say in effect these people are turkish citizens you can't do this to them and the turkish jews would be released if their businesses were confiscated the turkish diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored the nazis in general wanted to keep the friendship of turkey they hoped to be able to use turkey as a gateway for an invasion of the middle east and they also wanted to obtain chromium and manganese from turkey in order to keep turkish friendship they usually accepted these interventions on behalf of turkish jews the turkish diplomats sometimes went to the concentration camps to secure the release of turkish jews at times they even boarded trains hauling turkish jews to auschwitz for extermination and succeeded in getting them off the train most of the foreign jews were sent to a concentration camp at a place called drancy in paris and that's where most of the intercession by turkish consuls took place the greater problem came with the turkish jews who had abandoned their turkish citizenship and had become french citizens the consuls couldn't declare that these people were turkish citizens because they were not my book includes photographs of jews lining up in front of the turkish consulate either to get passports to return to turkey or to get a restoration of their turkish citizenship this was a bureaucratic matter so processing the application would take some time in the meantime it was a real emergency because the nazis would arrest jews on the streets for almost nothing the nazis would even arrest them if they had radios or telephones in their apartments because radios and telephones were forbidden to jews to take care of these former turkish jews the turkish diplomats invented a document called gayri muntazem vatandash or irregular fellow citizen the document said in effect this person is a former turkish citizen who has applied for the restoration of his turkish citizenship in the meantime we would appreciate it if you would treat him as if he were a turkish citizen the diplomats wrote the document in turkish and put their seals on it since the nazis could not read turkish on the whole they accepted these papers as certificates of citizenship by this means the turkish diplomats were able to rescue many jews who had relinquished their turkish citizenship actually the nazis were of two minds about the turkish defense of jews on the one hand the nazi foreign ministry which wanted to retain the friendship of turkey was in favor of accepting these interventions on the other hand himmler and eichmann wanted all jews exterminated at times himmler and eichmann were able to prevail and some of the turkish jews were sent off to auschwitz before the turkish consuls could do anything do you have statistics on how many turkish jews were rescued there were about NUM turkish jews in europe before world war ii about NUM of whom were living in france most of the information in this section of the book relates to the situation in france i have published the letters that the turkish consuls sent to the nazi officials and the letters that came back in reply generally the nazis said that if the turkish consul would present documents certifying that arrested individuals are turkish citizens and promise to send them out of france the nazis would release them from the concentration camp the turkish consuls also organized special trains to take turkish jews from nazioccupied territory back to turkey these trains ran regularly in NUM and NUM the nazis gave the turkish jews visas so they could pass out of nazi territory but the trains were often held up by the naziinfluenced governments of eastern europe croatia serbia and bulgaria because these governments really didn't want the jews to escape as a result of the turkish consuls' efforts about NUM to NUM of the turkish jews in france were saved another NUM were sent off to auschwitz where most of them died the remaining NUM either escaped across the border into spain or fled to the area of southern france occupied by the italians who treated jews much better than the nazis did at the end of NUM however italy fell out of the war and that was the end for those jews as well incidentally the turkish diplomats in nazioccupied greece also worked to rescue jews in that country the second part of your book then deals with turkish diplomats acting to rescue jews of turkish citizenship or turkish origin from nazi persecution yes and there is an aside i might add here in their interventions on behalf of turkish jews the turks cited their treaty with germany which stated that turkish citizens in german territory would be treated the same as german citizens in turkey on that basis the turks maintained that the nazis could not discriminate against turkish citizens who are jews the nazis claimed and the vichy government agreed that they were not discriminating because they were treating all jews equally turkey protested saying you are dividing our citizens according to religion but the turkish constitution requires that all citizens be treated equally regardless of religion therefore you cannot single out turkish jews american consuls in paris by contrast accepted the nazi argument and told american jews who were being persecuted by the nazis that they couldn't do anything about it because the american jews were being treated the same as other jews the third part of the book takes place in turkey which was the principal center during the holocaust for activities aimed at the rescue of eastern european jews the kwish agency an organization established by jews in palestine to help resettle jews to palestine set up an office in istanbul in NUM under the leadership of chaim barlas other jewish organizations in palestine especially the kibbutzes also sent representatives to istanbul to set up headquarters these groups first tried to contact jews in eastern europe to find out what was happening today we know about the holocaust but at that time people didn't know what was going on they didn't imagine the nazis could do the things they were doing and so the first step was to get information and the turkish government let them use the turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and friends in eastern europe the jewish organizations found out what was happening when they received replies later on when the nazis began to intercept such letters the jews received assistance also from the vatican nuncio angelo roncali who served as the vatican representative in istanbul from NUM to NUM and later became pope john xxiii as the vatican representative during the war he used the facilities of the catholic church to supplement what the turkish government was doing to assist jewish agencies in contacting jews in eastern europe with the cooperation of the turkish government these agencies then sent hard currency food clothing and even railroad and steamship tickets to jews in czechoslovakia bulgaria romania and hungary they weren't able to help much in poland because by then the nazis had wiped out almost all the polish jews whenever possible the rescue agencies arranged for the jews to get out of eastern europe either by train through the so called orient express route to istanbul or by boat through the black sea to istanbul turkey was not eager for all these refugees to remain within its borders during the war because it was being blockaded and was suffering terrible shortages of food and clothing the government therefore facilitated the movement of the nonturkish jewish refugees from turkey to palestine either by the taurus express railroad through the mountains to syria and palestine or by small boats across the eastern mediterranean from southern turkey to palestine these efforts were bitterly opposed not only by the nazis but also by the british who did not want any more jewish immigration to palestine because they feared it would hurt their relations with the arabs the british constantly pressured the turkish government to stop this traffic and send those jews back in a few cases the turkish government yielding to british pressure did send the boats back for example in one incident the steamship struma with some NUM jewish refugees from romania was sent back by the turkish government as a result of the intervention of the british ambassador when that ship was sunk by a soviet submarine all were lost except one person nevertheless all told the turkish government allowed no fewer than NUM eastern european jews to pass through turkish territory and move on to palestine during the second world war the turkish authorities also provided these refugees with facilities and money and gave them permission to send money and food out of the country many of these jews who passed through turkey may still be living in israel yes and their children but let's return for a moment to the first group the turkish jews who came from europe they did not go on to palestine they stayed in turkey it was the nonturkish eastern european jews who passed through turkey en route to palestine their story is very interesting and you have rescued it from obscurity many studies have been made of the holocaust but most of them do not focus on the eastern european or middle eastern jews most of the scholarship has centered on the western european jews of whom NUM million were massacred by the nazis my study deals with a much smaller number of people i have tried to round out the picture and i hope my book will persuade other scholars to undertake further investigations in the history of eastern jews when it comes to numbers the german jews were also relatively small in number most of the millions slain were polish jews the rescue of NUM eastern european jews may not seem so significant compared with the total of NUM million who were murdered but it meant a lot to those who were saved about threefourths of the book consists of documents translations of many documents they are included because the story is not well known not only are people in the west unaware of the courageous actions of the turkish diplomats even the people of turkey did not know the story i felt that they would not fully understand this remarkable achievement unless they could see the documents what languages are used in the documents most of them are in turkish or french some are in hebrew there is a great deal of material in hebrew about the organization of the boats going to palestine the passengers and so on but i did not go into those details extensively i describe mostly what turkey did so most of my documents are in turkish or french a few documents are in english the jewish groups in istanbul did not necessarily cooperate with one another to rescue jews in fact they often fought with one another they took turns trying to get the turkish government to deport rival groups for example some of the kibbutz groups felt that the jewish agency was run by western european jews who were interested only in helping western european jews finally in NUM president roosevelt sent a personal representative ira hirschman who had been an executive of bloomingdale's department store in new york city and hirschman managed to reconcile their differences the documents related to his mission are in english i also obtained many documents from serge klarsfeld a holocaust historian in france who mainly worked on the french jews his father was killed by the nazis he gave me materials he had gathered in the german archives on the turkish jews so i didn't personally consult the german archives i believe that much more can be learned from the german archives and i hope someone someday will make the effort this new book fits in well with your teaching doesn't it right i'm giving a course on the history of the jews of the ottoman empire i first gave the course two years ago in addition to research writing and teaching i've been actively involved in the commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the coming of the jews to the ottoman empire among other things i helped organize a large international conference on the subject which was held in istanbul in NUM now that your books are finished and the conference has taken place what do you plan to do next i'm working on two new books one is a history of the turkish war for independence which took place after world war i during the years NUM to NUM the turks warded off the efforts of the victorious european powers to occupy turkey and end its independence the second book is a study of sultan abdul hamid ii the last major sultan who ruled from NUM to NUM he was an important

know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to these young men are supported financially by iran most of the time they sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for israeli patrols every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians this a tried and true method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace thus forcing the opposing state to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or in order to avoid the deaths of civilians abandon the search certainly the people who use the population for cover are also to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm's way are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover israel should totally back down sothe easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives tell me tim what are these guerillas doing wrong assuming that they are using civilians for cover are they not killing soldiers in their country if the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on israel is it not working why is it further neccessary for israeli guns to pound lebanese villages why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone you see there is more to the shelling of the villages it is called retaliation getting back getting even it doesn't make sense to shell the villages the least it shows is a reckless disregard by the israeli government for the lives of civilians if israel insists that the so called security zone is necessary for the protection of northern israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers if israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from our land what so the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states can start all over again while i also hope for this to happen it will only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their soil they have to prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance towards antiisrael guerillas inresidence if israel is not willing to accept the word of others then imho it has no business wasting others' time coming to the peace talks i have written before on this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled good lord brad no i am not basil i think basil is a very intelligent person and i respect what he writes basil is a person that i would gladly call a friend he is however not me nor am i lebanese as some seem to suspect this is the only realistic solution it is time for israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed in fact it has caused much more israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel would have resulted in perhaps you are aware that to most communities of people there is the feeling that it is better that many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently accept our fate ifhowever you call on israel to see the sense of suffering fewer casualties i suggest you apply the same to palestinian arab and islamic groups tim you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians in lebanon have been disarmed hezbollah remains the only independent militia hezbollah does not attack israel except at a few times such as when the idf burned up sheikh mosavi his wife and young son of course if israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't make the lebanese so mad as to do that furthermore with hezbollah subsequently disarmed it would not be possible and now the lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of lebanon basil it has not without the support and active involvement of syria lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred once syria leaves who is to say that lebanon will be able to retain control if syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for israel tim when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the syrian border not lately eh israel knows very well that the syrians are able to restrain all who would use territory under their control to attack israel while lebanon would be better off with syria and israel out of its borders the presence of syrian troops in lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on israeli territory not on israeli troops in lebanon however please note the distinction in the past two years tim your view of this entire matter is far too serenely onesided and selectively naive i disagree basil has always seemed to me to be a coolheaded person slow to anger certainly more so than i what is most important is that he is an actual witness to things from the other end of

christianity and islam in other words judaism has fathered both religions now islam has turned against its father i may say it is ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone religion wars are going to be on the raise i thought the idea of believing on one god was to unite all man kind how come both jews and islam which believe on the same god the god of ebrahim are killing each other is this like dr frankenstien's story how are you going to stop this from happening how are you going to deal with so many muslims nuking them would distroy the whole world would god get mad since you have killed his followers you believe on the same god same heaven and the same hell after all what is the peacefull way of ending this saga judaism did not father islam we had many of the same prophets but judaism ignores prophets later prophets including jesus christ who christians and muslims believe in and mohammed the idea of believing in one god should unite all peoples however note that christianity and islam reflect the fact that there are people with different views and the rights of nonchristians and nonmuslims are stated in each religion man kind needs religion since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state a religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society the praying keeps the sole healthy and meditates it god does not care for man kinds pray but man kind hopes that god will help him when he prays religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life but the religious leaders need to make a living through religion so they may corrupt it or turn it to their own way to make their living ie muslims have to pay NUM percent of their income to the mullahs i guess the rabie gets his cut too we are supposed to pay NUM of our income after all necessities are paid please note that this NUM is on a personal basis if you are poor there is no need to pay quite the contrary this money most often goes to the poor in each in country and to the poor muslims around the world also this money is not required in the human sense ie a muslim never knocks at your door to ask for money and nobody makes a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid and we surely don't pass money baskets around during our prayer services is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other be good toward each other helps one another respect the mother nature is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts that we take today is in it that within every man there is good and bad he could choose either one then he will see the outcome of his choice how can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion how can we stop another religious killing field under poor gods name what are your thoughts do you think man kind would to come its senses before it is too late ps on the side do you think that moses saw the god on mount sina why would god go to top of the mountain he created the earth he could have been anywhere why on top the mountain was it because people thought to see god you have to reach to the skiesheavens why god kept coming back to middle east was it because they created god through their imagination is that why jewish people were told by god they were the chosen ones god's presence is certainly on earth but since god is everywhere god may show signs of existence in other places as well we can not say for sure where god has shown signs of his existence and where he has not profit mohammad was married to khadijeh she was a jewish she taught him how to trade she probably taught him about judaism quran is mostly copy right of taurah sp old testement do you think god wrote quran makeh was a trade city before islam do you think it was made to be the center of islamic world because mohammad wanted to expand his trade business is that why god has put his house in there the qur'an is not a copyright of the taurah muslims believe that the taurah the bible and the qur'an originally contained much the same message thus the many similiarities however the taurah and the bible have been 'translated' into other languages which has changed their meaning over time a translation also reflects some of the personal views of the translators the qur'an still exists in the same language that it was revealed in arabic therefore we know that mankind has not changed its meaning it is truly what was revealed to mohammed at that time there are many scientific facts which were not discovered by traditional scientific methods until much later such as the development of the baby in the mother's womb i think this religious stuff has gone too far all man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up look at david koresh how that turned out i am afraid in the bigger scale the jews and the muslims will have the same ending only god knows for sure how it will turn out i hope it won't but if that happens it was the will of god religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things rather than plotting each others distruction there is one earth one life and one god let's all man kind be good toward each other god help us all peace please send this mail to me again so i can read the rest of what you said

they were already old when they said it like that i guessed immediately i went and said doctor they've brought shagen in dead he says why are you carrying on like that dead dead he's alive but then he went all the same and when he came back the look on his face was i could tell immediately that he was dead they knew one another well shagen had worked for him a long time i say doctor is it shagen he says no emma it's not he it's somebody else entirely i say doctor why are you deceiving me i'll find out all the same anyway if not today then tomorrow and he said i screamed right there in the office he says emma go go calm down a little another one of our colleagues said that the doctor had said it was shagen but in hideous condition they tried to calm me down saying it wasn't shagen a few minutes later another colleague comes in and says oh poor emma when she said it like that there was no hope left that day was awful they were endlessly bringing in dead and injured people at night someone took me home i said igor papa's been killed on the morning of the 1st i left igor at home again and went to the hospital i had to bury him somehow do something i look and see that the hospital is surrounded by soldiers they are wearing dark clothes hey citizen where are you going i say i work here and from inside someone shouts yes yes that's our cook let her in i went right to the head doctor's office and there is a person from the city health department there he used to work with us at the hospital he says emma shagen's been taken to baku in the night they took the wounded and the dead all of them to baku i say doctor how will i bury him he says we're taking care of all that don't you worry we'll do everything we'll tell you about it where did you spend the night i say i was at

name is kagramanov the head doctor's name is izyat jamalogli sadukhov the ambulance arrived and i went home and got igor they admitted him as a patient they gave us a private room an isolation room we stayed in the hospital until the 4th some police car came and they said emma let's go and the women our colleagues then they saw the police car became anxious and said where are you taking her i say they're going to kill me too and the investigator says why are you saying that we're going to make a positive identification we went to baku and they took me into the morgue i still can't remember what hospital it was the investigator says let's go we need to be certain maybe it's not shagen and when i saw the caskets lying on top of one another i went out of my mind i say i can't look no the investigator says are there any identifying marks i say let me see the clothes or the shoes or even a sock i'll recognize them he says isn't they're anything on his body i say he has seven gold teeth and his finger he only has half of one of his fingers shagen was a carpenter he had been injured at work they brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing they brought them and they were all burned when i saw them i shouted oh they burned him i shouted i don't know i fell down or maybe i sat down i don't remember and that investigator says well fine fine since we've identified that these are his clothes and since his teeth since he has seven gold teeth on the 4th they told me emma it's time to bury shagen now i cried how how can i bury shagen when i have only one son and he's sick i should inform his relatives he has three sisters i can't do it by myself they say ok you know the situation how will they get here from karabagh how will they get here from yerevan there's no transportation it s impossible he was killed on february NUM and i buried him on march NUM we buried him in sumgait they asked me where do you want to bury him i said i want to bury him in karabagh where we were born let me bury him in karabagh i'm shouting and the head of the burial office i guess says do you know what it means take him to karabagh it means arson i say what do you mean arson don't they know what's going on in karabagh the whole world knows that they killed them and i want to take him to karabagh i don't have anyone anymore i begged i pleaded i grieved i even got down on my knees he says let's bury him here now and in three months in six months a year if it calms down i'll help you move him to karabagh our trial was the first in sumgait it was concluded on may NUM at the investigation the murderer tale ismailov told how it all happened but then at the trial he tried to wriggle he tried to soften his crime then they brought a videotape recorder i guess and played it and said ismailov look is that you he says yes well look here you're describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime right he says yes and now you're telling it differently he says well maybe i forgot like that the witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going along mir street there was a crowd of about NUM people shagen had a volga gaz21 the NUM people surrounded his car and all NUM of them were involved one of them was this ismailov guy this tale theyit's unclear whostarted pulling shagen out of the car well one says from the left side of the car another says from the right side they pulled off his sports jacket he had a jacket on well they ask him what's your nationality he says armenian well they say from the crowd they shouted if he's an armenian kill him kill him they started beating him they broke seven of his ribs and his heart i don't know they did something there too it's too awful to tell about anyway they say this tale guy he had an armature shaft he says i picked it up it was lying near a bush that's where i got it he said he picked it up but the witnesses say that he had already had it he said i hit him twice he said once or twice on the head with that rod and he said that when he started to beat him shagen was sitting on the ground and when he hit him he fell over he said i left right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment killing someone he says and i came back to look is that shagen alive or not i said you wanted to finish him right and if he was still alive you came back to hit him again he went back and looked and he was already dead after that that bastard tale said after that i went home i said you you little snake i said are you a thief and a murderer shagen had had money in his jacket and a watch on his wrist they were taken he says he didn't take them when they overturned and burned the car that tale was no longer there it was other people who did that who it was who turned over the car and who burned it that hasn't been clarified as yet i told the investigator how can you have the trial when you don't know who burned the car he said something but i didn't get what he was saying but i said you still haven't straightened everything out i think that's unjust when they burned the car he was lying next to it and the fire spread to him in the death certificate it says that he had thirddegree burns over NUM percent of his body and i ask again why was he killed my husband was a carpenter he was a good craftsman he knew how to do everything he even fixed his own car with his own hands we have three children three sons only igor was with me at the time the older one was in pyatigorsk and the younger one is serving in the army and now they're fatherless i couldn't sit all the way through it when the procurator read up to NUM years' deprivation of freedom i just i went out of my mind i didn't know what to do with myself i said how can that

those people were streaming down our street they were shouting long live turkey and glory to turkey and during the trial i said to that ismailov what does that mean 'glory to turkey' i still don't

great now after the sumgait tragedy we the victims divide our lives into before and ''after we talk like that that was before the war like the people who went through world war ii and considered it a whole epoch a fate no matter how many years go by no matter how long we live it will never be forgotten on the contrary some of the moments become even sharper in our rage in our sorrow we saw everything differently but now they say that you can see more with distance and we can see those inhuman events with more clarity now we more acutely perceive our losses and everything that happened nineteen eightyeight was a leap year everyone fears a leap year and wants it to pass as quickly as possible yet we never thought that that leap year would be such a black one for every sumgait armenian those who lost someone and those who didn't that second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family although you could already smell danger in the air but we didn't think that the danger was near and possible so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves at least as my parents say at least we should have done something to save the children my parents themselves are not that old NUM and NUM years but then they thought that they had already lived enough and did everything they could to save us in our apartment the tragedy started on february NUM around five in the afternoon i call it a tragedy and i repeat it was a tragedy even though all our family survived when i recall how they broke down our door my skin crawls even now among armenians among people who wish me only well i feel like it's all starting over again i remember how that mob broke into our apartment my parents were standing in the hall my father had an axe in his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors our door was rarely locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by we're known as a hospitable family and we just never really thought about whether the people who were coming to see us were azerbaijanis jews or russians we had friends of many nationalities even a turkmen woman my parents were in the hall my father with an axe i remember him telling my mother run to the kitchen for a knife but mother was detached pale as though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer to be honest i never expected it of her she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark a girlfriend was at the house that day a russian girl lyuda and mamma said no matter what happens no matter what they do to us you're not to come out of the bedroom we're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment we went into the bedroom there were four of us marina and the russian girl crawled under the bed and we covered them up with a rug boxes of dishes and karina and i are standing there and looking at one another the idea that perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside me i'm an emotional person and i express my emotions immediately i wanted to embrace her and kiss her as though it were the last second and maybe karina was thinking the same thing but she's quite reserved we didn't have time to say anything to each other because we immediately heard mamma raise a shout there was so much noise from the tramping of feet from the shouting and from excited voices i couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door to the bedroom was only open a crack but when mamma shouted the second time karina ran out of the bedroom i ran after her i had wanted to hold her back but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us immediately the only thing i managed to do was close the door behind me at least so as to save marina and her friend the mob was shouting all of their eyes were shining all red like from insomnia at first about NUM people burst in but later i was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see they came into the hall into the kitchen and dragged my father into the other room he didn't utter a word he just raised the axe to hit them but mamma snatched the axe from behind and said tell them not to touch the children tell them they can do as they want with us but not to harm the children she said this to father in armenian there were azerbaijanis from armenia among the mob who broke in they understood armenian perfectly the local azerbaijanis don't know armenian they don't need to speak it and one of them responded in armenian you and your children both we're going to do the same thing to you and your children that you armenians did in kafan they killed our women our girls our mothers they cut their breasts off and burned our houses and so on and so forth and we came to do the same thing to you this whole time some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us they were mostly young people under NUM at first there weren't any older people among them and all of their faces were unfamiliar sumgait is a small town all the same and we know a lot of people by their faces especially me i'm a teacher so they dragged my father into the other room they twisted his arms and took him in there no they didn't take him in there they dragged him in there because he was already unable to walk they closed the door to that room all but a crack we couldn't see what was happening to father what they were doing to him then a young man about NUM years old started to tear off mamma's sarafan and mamma shouted at him in azerbaijani i'm old enough to be your mother what are you doing he struck her now he's being held mamma identified him i hope he's convicted then they went after karina who's been talking to them like a komsomol leader as though she were trying to lead them down a different path as they say to influence their consciousness she told them that what they were doing was wrong that they mustn't do it she said come on let's straighten this out without emotions what do you want who are you why did you come here what did we ever do to you someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come into our home but then the ones in the backmore of them kept coming and comingsaid what are you talking to them for you should kill them we came here to kill them they pushed karina struck her and she fell down they beat her but she didn't cry out even when they tore her clothes off she kept repeating what did we do to you what did we do to you and even later when she came to she said mamma what did we do to them why did they do that to us that group was prepared i know this because i noticed that some of them only broke up furniture and others only dealt with us i remember that when they were beating me when they were tearing my clothes off i felt neither pain nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to karina all i could do was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her and what they did to her that's why i felt no pain later when they carried karina off they beat her savagely it's really amazing that she not only lived but didn't lose her mind she is very beautiful and they did everything they could to destroy her beauty mostly they beat her face with their fists kicking her using anything they could find mamma karina and i were all in one room and again i didn't feel any pain just didn't feel any no matter how much they beat me no matter what they did then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the apartment they broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the corners so there would be more room then someone suggested let's take her outside those beasts were in heaven they did what they would do every day if they weren't afraid of the authorities those were their true colors at the time i thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't afraid of what would happen to them when they carried karina out and beat mammaher face was completely covered with bloodthat's when i started to feel the pain i blacked out several times from the pain but each moment that i had my eyes open it was as though i were recording it all on film i think i'm a kind person by nature but i'm vengeful especially if someone is mean to me and i don't deserve it i hold a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain and every time i would come to and see one of those animals on top of me i'd remember them and i'll remember them for the rest of my life even though people tell me forget you have to forget you have to go on living at some point i remember that they stood me up and told me something and despite the fact that i hurt all overi had been beaten terriblyi found the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures i realized that i had to do something resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering to an end i pushed one of them away he was a real horse i remember now that he's being held too as though they were all waiting for it they seized me and took me out onto the balcony i had long hair and it was stuck all over me one of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open and i realized that they planned to throw me out the window because they had already picked me up with their hands i was up in the air as though for the last time i took a really deep breath and closed my eyes and somehow braced myself inside i suddenly became cold as though my heart had sunk into my feet and suddenly i felt myself flying i couldn't figure out if i was really flying or if i just imagined it when i came to i thought now i'm going to smash on the ground and when it didn't happen i opened my eyes and realized that i was still lying on the floor and since i didn't scream didn't beg them at all they became all the more wild like wolves they started to trample me with their feet shoes with heels on them and iron horseshoes like they had spe cially put them on then i lost consciousness i came to a couple of times and waited for death summoned it beseeched it some people ask for good health life happiness but at that moment i didn't need any of those things i was sure that none of us would survive and i had even forgotten about marina and if none of us was alive it wasn't worth living there was a moment when the pain was especially great i withstood inhuman pain and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come because i had showed myself to be so tenacious i started to strangle myself and when i started to wheeze they realized that with my death i was going to put an end to their pleasures and they pulled my hands from my throat the person who injured and insulted me most painfully i remember him very well because he was the oldest in the group he looked around NUM i know that he has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person one who would never do such a thing something came over him then you see even during the investigation he almost called me daughter he apologized although of course he knew that i'd never forgive him something like that i can never forgive i have never injured anyone with my behavior with my words or with my deeds i have always put myself in the other person's shoes but then in a matter of hours they trampled me entirely i shall never forget it i wanted to do myself in then because i had nothing to lose because no one could protect me my father who tried to do something against that hoard of beasts by himself could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything i knew that i was even sure that he was no longer alive and ira melkumian my acquaintance i knew her and had been to see her family a couple of timesher brother tried to save her and couldn't so he tried to kill her his very own sister he threw an axe at her to kill her and put an end to her suffering when they stripped her clothes off and carried her into the other room her brother knew what awaited her i don't know which one it was edik or igor both of them were in the room from which the axe was thrown but the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her and made her death even more excruciating maybe the most excruciating of all the deaths of those days in sumgait i heard about it all from the neighbor from the melkumians' landing his name is makhaddin he knows my family a little he came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in baku how we were feeling and if we needed anything he's a good person he said you should praise god that you all survived but what i saw with my own eyes i a man who has seen so many people die who has lived a whole life i he says nearly lost my mind that day i had never seen the likes of it and think i never shall again the door to his apartment was open and he saw everything one of the brothers threw the axe because they had already taken the father and mother out of the apartment igor edik and ira remained he saw ira naked being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven people he told us about it and said he would never forget it he heard the brothers shouting something inarticulate from pain rage and the fact that they were powerless to do anything but all the same they tried to do something the guy who got hit with the axe lived i i after i had been unsuccessful at killing myself i saw them taking marina and lyuda out of the bedroom i was in such a state that i couldn't even remember my sister's name i wanted to cry marina out to her but could not i looked at her and knew that it was a familiar dear face but couldn't for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was and thus i saved her because when they were taking her out she as it turns out had told them that she had just been visiting and that she and lyuda were both there by chance that they weren't armenians lyuda's a russian you can tell right away and marina speaks azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that she was an azerbaijani and i almost gave her away and doomed her i'm glad that at least marina came out of this all in good physical health although her spirit was murdered at some point i came to and saw igor igor agayev my acquaintance in that mob he lives in the neighboring building for some reason i remembered his name maybe i sensed my defense in him i called out to him in russian igor help but he turned away and went into the bedroom just then they were taking marina and lyuda out of the bedroom igor said he knew marina and lyuda that marina in fact was azerbaijani and he took both of them to the neighbors and the idea stole through me that maybe igor had led them to our apartment something like that but if he was my friend he was supposed to save me then they were striking me very hardwe have an indian vase a metal one they were hitting me on the back with it and i blacked outthey took me out onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window they were already sure that i was dead because i didn't react at all to the new blows someone said she's already dead let's throw her out when they carried me out onto the balcony for the second time when i was about to die the second time i heard someone say in azerbaijani don't kill her i know her she's a teacher i can still hear that voice ringing in my ears but i can't remember whose voice it was it wasn't igor because he speaks azerbaijani with an accent his mother is russian and they speak russian at home he speaks azerbaijani worse than our marina does i remember when they carried me in and threw me on the bed he came up to me that person and i having opened my eyes saw and recognized that person but immediately passed out cold i had been beaten so much that i didn't have the strength to remember him i only remember that this person was older and he had a high position unfortunately i can't remember anything more what should i say about igor he didn't treat me badly i had heard a lot about him that he wasn't that good a person that he sometimes drank too much once he boasted to me that he had served in afghanistan he knew that women usually like bravery in a man especially if a man was in afghanistan if he was wounded then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated very sympathetically with respect later i found out that he had served in ufa and was injured but that's not in afghanistan of course i found that all out later among the people who were in our apartment my karina also saw the secretary of the party organization i don't know his last name his first name is najaf he is an armenianborn azerbaijani but later karina wasn't so sure she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw and she didn't want to endanger him she said he was there and a little while later maybe they beat me so much that i am confusing him with someone else no it seems like it was he i am sure it was he because when he came to see us the first time he said one thing and the next time he said something entirely different the investigators haven't summoned him yet he came to see us in the khimik boarding house where we were living at the time he brought groceries and flowers this was right before march 8th he almost started crying he was so upset to see our condition i don't know if he was putting us on or not but later after we had told the investigator and they summoned him to the procuracy he said that he had been in baku he wasn't in sumgait the fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that karina is right that in fact it was he who was in our apartment i don't know how the investigators are now treating him at one point i wondered and asked and was told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment couldn't he have gone to baku and arranged an alibi i'm not ruling out that possibility ill now return to our apartment mamma had come to you could say that she bought them off with the gold father gave her when they were married her wedding band and her watch were gold she bought her own and her husband's lives with them she gave the gold to a 14year old boy vadim vorobyev a russian boy he speaks azerbaijani perfectly he's an orphan who was raised by his grandfather and who lives in sumgait on nizami street he goes to a special school one for mentally handicapped children but i'll say thisi'm a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes i can form an opinionthat boy is not at all mentally handicapped he's healthy he can think just fine and analyze too policemen should be so lucky and he's cunning too after that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album he beat mamma and demanded gold saying lady if you give us all the gold and money in your apartment we'll let you live and mamma told them where the gold was he brought in the bag and opened it shook out the contents and everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it started knocking each other over and taking the gold from one another i'm surprised they didn't kill one another right then mamma was still in control of herself she had been beaten up her face was black and blue from the blows and her eyes were filled with blood and she ran into the other room father was lying there tied up with a gag in his mouth and a pillow over his face there was a broken table on top of the pil low mamma grabbed father and he couldn't walk like me he was half dead halfway into the other world he couldn't comprehend anything couldn't see and was covered with black and blue mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth it was some sort of cloth i think it was a slipcover from an armchair the bandits were still in our apartment even in the room mamma pulled father out of led him out of carried him out of we had two armchairs in that room a small magazine table a couch a television and a screen three people were standing next to that screen and into their shirts their pants everywhere imaginable they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee servicemamma saw them out of the corner of her eye she said i was afraid to turn around i just seized father and started pulling him but at the threshold i couldn't hold him up he fell down and i picked him up again and dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors' mamma remembered one of the criminals the one who had watched her with his face halfturned toward her out of one eye she says i realized that my death would come from that person i looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing later they caught that scoundrel meanwhile mamma grabbed father and left i was alone igor had taken marina away mamma and father were gone karina was already outside i didn't know what they were doing to her i was left all alone and at that moment i became someone else do you understand even though i knew that neither mother and father in the other room nor marina and lyuda under the bed could save me all the same i somehow managed to hold out i went on fighting them i bit someone i remember and i scratched another but when i was left alone i realized what kind of people they were the ones i had observed the ones who beat karina what kind of people they were the ones who beat me that it was all unnecessary that i was about to die and that all of that would die with me at some point i took heart when i saw the young man from the next building i didn't know his name but we would greet one another when we met we knew that we were from the same microdistrict when i saw him i said neighbor is that you in so doing i placed myself in great danger he realized that if i lived i would remember him that's when he grabbed the axe the axe that had been taken from my father i automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to take the blow of the axe although at the time it would have been better if he had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery when he started getting ready to wind back for the blow someone came into the room the newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in the air everyone stood at attention for this guy like soldiers in the presence of a general everyone waited for his word continue the atrocities or not he said enough let's go to the third entryway in the third entryway they killed uncle shurik aleksandr gambarian this confirms once again that they had prepared in advance almost all of them left with him as they went picking up pillows blankets whatever they needed whatever they found all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot someone else had already taken the other four people remained in the room soldiers who didn't obey their general they had to have come recently because other faces had flashed in front of me over those NUM to NUM hours but i had never seen those three one of them kuliyev i identified him later a native of the sisian district of armenia an azerbaijani had moved to azerbaijan a year before he told me in armenian sister don't be afraid i'll drive those three azerbaijanis out of here that's just what he said those azerbaijanis as though he himself were not azerbaijani but some other nationality he said with such hatred i'll drive them out of here now and you put your clothes on and find a hammer and nails and nail the door shut because they'll be coming back from apartment NUM that's when i found out that they had gone to apartment NUM before that the person in the eskimo dogskin coat the one who came in and whom they listened to the general said that they were going to the third entryway kuliyev helped me get some clothes on because l couldn't do it by myself marina's old fur coat was lying on the floor he threw it over my shoulders i was racked with shivers and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer he wanted to give them to me so that when he left i could nail the door shut but the door was lying on the floor in the hall i went out onto the balcony there were broken windows and flowers and dirt from flowerpots were scattered on the floor it was impossible to find anything he told me well fine i won't leave you here would any of the neighbors let you in they'll be back they won't calm down they know you're alive he told me all this in armenian then he returned to the others and said what are you waiting for leave they said ah you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her yourself no we want to do it to he urged them on but gently not coarsely because he was alone against them although they were still just boys not old enough to be drafted he led them out of the room and went down to the third floor with them himself and said leave what's the mat ter aren't you men go fight with the men what do you want of her and he came back upstairs they wanted to come up after him and he realized that he couldn't hold them off forever then he asked me where he could hide me i told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor apartment NUM we were on really good terms with them we knocked on the door and he explained in azerbaijani the neighbor woman opened the door and immediately said i'm an azerbaijani he said i know let her sit at your place a while don't open the door to anyone no one knows about this i won't tell anyone let her stay at your place she says fine have her come in i went in she cried a bit and gave me some stockings i had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders i burst into tears even though i was wearing marina's old fur coat it's a short one a halflength i was cold all the same i asked do you know where my family is what happened to them she says no i don't know anything i'm afraid to go out of the apartment now they're so wild that they don't look to see who's azerbaijani and who's armenian kuliyev left ten minutes later my neighbor says you know lyuda i don't want to lose my life because of you or my son and his wife go stay with someone else during the butchery in our apartment one of the scum a sadist took my earring in his mouthi had pearl earrings onand ripped it out tearing the earlobe the other earring was still there when i'm nervous i fix my hair constantly and then when i touched my ear i noticed that i had one earring on i took it out and gave it to her she took the earring but she led me out of the apartment i went out and didn't know where to go i heard someone going upstairs i don't know who it was but assumed it was them with tremendous difficulty i end up to our apartment i wanted to die in my own home i go into the apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place to the fifth floor i had to do something i went into the bedroom where marina and lyuda had hidden and saw that the bed was overturned instead of hiding i squatted near some broken christmas ornaments found an unbroken one and started sobbing then they came in someone said that there were still some things to take i think that someone pushed me under the bed i lay on the floor and there were broken ornaments on it under my head and legs i got all cut up but i lay there without moving my heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town could hear it there were no lights on maybe that's what saved me they were burning matches and toward the end they brought in a candle they started picking out the clothes that could still be worn they took father's sport jacket and a bedspread the end of which was under my head they pulled on the one end and it felt like they were pulling my hair out i almost cried out and again i realized i wasn't getting out of there alive and i started to strangle myself again i took my throat in one hand and pressed the other on my mouth so as not to wheeze so that i would die and they would only find me afterward they were throwing the burned matches under the bed and i got burned but i withstood it something inside of me held on someone's hand was protecting me to the end i knew that i was going to die but i didn't know how i knew that if i survived i would walk out of that apartment but if i found out that one of my family had died i would die for sure because i had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on living without your mother or father or without your sister marina i thought was still alive she went to lyuda's place or someone is hiding her i tried to think that igor wouldn't let them be killed he served in afghanistan he should protect her while i was strangling myself i said my goodbyes to everyone and then i thought how could marina survive alone if they killed all of us how would she live all by herself there were six people in the room they talked among themselves and smoked one talked about his daughter saying that there was no children's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter another said that he liked the apartmentrecently we had done a really good job fixing everything upand that he would live there after everything was all over they started to argue a third one says how come you get it i have four children and there are three rooms here that's just what i need all these years i've been living in godawful places another one says neither of you gets it we'll set fire to it and leave then someone said that azerbaijanis live right next door the fire could move over to their place and they to my good fortune didn't set fire to the apartment and left oh yes i just remembered while they were raping me they repeated quite frequently let the armenian women have babies for us muslim babies let them bear azerbaijanis for the struggle against the armenians then they said those muslims can carry on our holy cause heroes

of establishing a state not an exclusive state if the state was to be exclusive it would not have NUM NUM arab citizens could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of israel right after it was formed and no i do not consider the purchase of land a hostile action when someone wants to buy land and someone else is willing to sell it at a mutually agreeable price then that is commerce it is not a hostile action leading to war no one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity palestinians are no exception perhaps you heard about antitrust in the business world since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such transactions basic antitrust law says that while you can purchase ibm stocks for the purpose of investing you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling ibm you can do so only if you make your intentions clear apriori clearly the jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate they were establishing a bridgehead for the european jews the palastenians sold their properties to the jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality being a multiethnic multireligious society accepting the jews as neighbours was no different just another religion plus they paid fair market value etc they did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy i'm not a conspiracy theorist myself but this one is hard to dismiss as to whether the jews wanted to live in peace maybe however they wanted and still want an exclusively jewish state where jews are in control and jews are the masters of the land living in peace is meaningless unless it means living with someone else as equal for a native arab this does not leave many options oh you mean like both jews and arabs being citizens the arabs who stayed are now citizens with as much right to choose who they vote for as the jews again adam the devil is in the details i don't want to get on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its ok to return NUM deportes and leave the rest because NUM is a nice number that you can devide by NUM NUM and besides it has an integer square root those palestinians who stayed actually stayed despite of what happened and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless and ineffective minority if i were wrong you'd have israel recall all the palestinian refugees we're talking millions after all they are civilians huh the people who left did so voluntarily there is no reason for israel to let them in do you actually believe this my experience tells me that every palestinian i knew still keeps the key to his home in palestine besides they often refer to their exodus as an escape from hell so to speak i know none that agrees with you did you sample their opinions i know you don't care just being rethorical israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it had to maintain a democratic facade to keep the western aid flowing israel got no western aid in NUM nor in NUM or 50it still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained and how is granting citizenship a facade don't get me wrong i beleive that israel is democratic within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group jews israel probably had a few options after NUM ethnic cleansing serbian style and deserve the wrath of the international community or make the best out of a no win condition show the world how good israel is towards the 'bad' arabs personaly i've never heard anything about the arab community in isreal except that they're there so yes they're there but as a community with history and roots its dead tell me something sam what makes land arab how shall i explain its a contract between the man and the land control isn't it the ottomans ruled NUM years and then left with barely a trace the concept of land identity is somewhat foreign to the mobile and pragmatic west it is partly the concept of 'le sol natal' native soil i know that jews had previous history in the region but none in recent memory i'm talking everyday life not archeology try again you tell me what its isn't but you fail to establish what it is also jews did have history in israel for over a thousand years there were lots of jews slaughtered by crusaders in israel there was a thriving community in gaza city from roughly NUM jews were a majority in jerusalem from NUM or so onwards does that make the land jewish i stand corrected i meant that the jewish culture was not

israel deported more than NUM palestinians to lebanon in response to hamas's kidnapping and execution of an israeli soldier a longer version appears in the may issue of harper's magazine which obtained and translated the tape my name is yasir hammad alhassan ali i live in nuseirat a refugee camp in the gaza strip i was born in NUM i finished high school then attended gaza polytechnic later i went to work for islamic university in gaza as a clerk i'm married and i have two daughters the qassam battalions are the only group in palestine explicitly dedicated to jihad holy war our primary concern is palestinians who collaborate with the enemy many young men and women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the israeli security services since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime our most important objective must be to put an end to the plague of collaboration to do so we abduct collaborators intimidate and interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose the methods that the enemy uses to lure palestinians into collaboration in the first place in addition to that naturally we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them we don't execute every collaborator after all about NUM percent of them are innocent victims tricked or blackmailed into their misdeeds the decision whether to execute a collaborator is based on the seriousness of his crimes if like many collaborators he has been recruited as an agent of the israeli border guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once he's as dangerous as an israeli soldier so we treat him like an israeli soldier there's another group of collaborators who perform an even more loathsome role the ones who help the enemy trap young men and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become collaborators i regard the isqat the process by which a palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration of single person as greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator if someone is guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat than it is our religious duty to execute him a third group of collaborators is responsible for the distribution of narcotics they work on direct orders from the security services to distribute drugs as widely as possible their victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and impossible to afford more they collaborate in order to get the drugs they crave the dealers must also be executed in the battalions we have developed a very careful method of uncovering collaborators we can't afford to abduct an innocent person because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished forever we will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after evidence of his guilt has been established never before if after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any doubt then he is executed in many cases we don't have to make our evidence against collaborators public because everyone knows that they're guilty but when the public isn't aware that a certain individual is a collaborator and we accuse him people are bound to ask for evidence many people will proclaim his innocence so there must be irrefutable proof before he is executed this proof is usually obtained in the form of a confession at first every collaborator denies his crimes so we start off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him we tell him that he still has a chance to serve his people even in the last moment of his life by confessing and giving us the information we need we say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has been a victim that kind of talk is convincing most of them confess after that others hold out in those cases we apply pressure both psychological and physical then the holdouts confess as well only one collaborator has ever been executed without an interrogation in that case the collaborator had been seen working for the border guard since before the intifada and he himself confessed his involvement to a friend who disclosed the information to us in addition three members of his network of collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat with this much evidence there was no need to interrogate him but we are very careful to avoid wrongful executions in every case our principal is the same the accused should be interrogated until he himself confesses his crimes a few weeks ago we sat down and complied a list of collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be executed without interrogation an although we had hundreds of names still because of our fear of god and of hell we could not mark any of these men except for the one i just mentioned for execution when we execute a collaborator in public we use a gun but after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator we can't shoot him to do so might give away our locations that's why collaborators are strangled sometimes we ask the collaborator what do you think how should we execute you one collaborator told us strangle me he hated the sight of blood naftaly stramer intergraph electronics internet nstramerdazixcoingrcom NUM

details of extensive adl spy operation emerge inquiry transcripts reveal nearly NUM years of espionage by a man who infiltrated political groups by richard c paddock times staff writer san francisco to the outside world roy bullock was a smalltime art dealer who operated from his house in the castro district in reality he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the antidefamation league for nearly NUM years his code name at the prominent jewish organization was cal and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an arabamerican delegation that visited rep nancy pelosi dsan francisco in her washington dc office for a time cal tapped into the phone message system of the white aryan resistance to learn of hate crimes from police sources he obtained privileged personal information on at least NUM people and he met surreptitiously with agents of the south african government to trade his knowledge for crisp new NUM bills these are among the secrets that bullock and david gurvitz a former los angelesbased operative divulged in extensive interviews with police and the fbi in a growing scandal over the nationwide intelligence network operated by the antidefamation league officials of the antidefamation league while denying any improper activity have said they will cooperate with the investigation they have refused to discuss bullock and gurvitz transcripts of the interviews among nearly NUM pages of documents released by san francisco prosecutors last week offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory at times the intelligence activities took on a cloakanddagger air with laundered payments shredded documents hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like ironsides and flipper on one occasion gurvitz recounts he received a tip that a propalestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for haifa israel although the antidefamation league publicly denies any ties to israel gurvitz phoned an israeli consular official to warn him shortly afterward another official called gurvitz back and debriefed him the court papers also added to the mystery of tom gerard a former cia agent and san francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the antidefamation league gerard fled to the philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the fbi but left behind a briefcase in his police locker its contents included passports driver's licenses and identification cards in NUM different names identification cards in his own name for four american embassies in central america and a collection of blank birth certificates army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads a black hood apparently for use in interrogations and photos of blindfolded and chained men investigators suspect that gerard and other police sources gave the adl confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people including as many as NUM members of one target group the arabamerican antidiscrimination committee each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony san francisco police inspector ron roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant the antidefamation league a selfdescribed jewish defense and civil rights organization acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are antisemitic extremist or racist the adl's factfinding division headed by irwinn suall in new york enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists however evidence seized from bullock's computer shows he kept files on at least NUM groups of all political stripes including the american civil liberties union earth island institute the united farm workers jews for jesus mother jones magazine the center for investigative reporting the bo gritz for president committee the asian law caucus and the aids activist group act up the computer files also included information on several members of congress including pelosi house armed services committee chairman ron dellums dberkeley and former republican rep pete mccloskey from the bay area in their statements bullock and gurvitz said the antidefamation league has collected information on political activists in the los angeles area for more than NUM years they said they worked closely with three los angeles county sheriff's deputies who specialized in intelligence work a los angeles police department antiterrorism expert and a san diego county sheriff's department intelligence officer a spokesman for the los angeles sheriff's department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the adl the los angeles police department which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation and the san diego sheriff's department declined comment bullock NUM is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama although he is not jewish he began working undercover as a volunteer for the adl and the fbi in indiana in NUM after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the communist party bullock moved to los angeles in NUM and was given a paid position by the adl as an intelligence operative he told authorities in the mid1970s he moved to san francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the west coast to keep his identity secret his salary has always been funneled through beverly hills attorney bruce i hochman who has never missed a payment in more than NUM years bullock said i was an investigator for the adl i investigated any and all antidemocratic movements bullock said officially i'm only a contract worker with bruce hochman that way the league would not be officially connected with me bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from communists to arabamerican to gay radicals to skinheads usually using his own name but once adopting the alias elmer fink i'm one of a kind he told police in recent years however his adl affiliation has increasingly become known and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him in the mid1980s he helped san francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist cory phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police in part because of this investigation he became close friends with gerard who at the time was working in the san francisco police intelligence division bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups an fbi report noted how he investigated one palestinian group bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash and would share the reports with gerard bullock also gave the trash to gerard for gerard to examine gerard would later return the trash to bullock from a wide range of sources bullock compiled files on NUM individuals and more than NUM political groups gerard whose files contained many identical entries kept files on NUM people in NUM bullock and gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the south african government bullock tells of meetings secretly with south african agents at san francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new NUM bills bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources once he rewrote an innocuous item published by san francisco chronicle columnist herb caen about south african bishop desmond tutu and the wife of prominent attorney melvin belli and submitted it as his own work bullock said it was gerard who sold official police intelligence bullock said he split about NUM from the south african government evenly with gerard telling him at one point i may be gay but i'm a straight arrow in his interviews with the police and fbi bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law for example bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records and criminal histories from gerard on about NUM people a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer and he said gerard gave him complete san francisco police department intelligence files on various nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy bullock said he also received a confidential fbi report on the nation of islam that he later shredded at the antidefamation league's san francisco office bullock seemed proud of his operation eavesdrop in which he used a paid informant codenamed scumbag to help tap into a white aryan resistance phone message network listening to the messages left by members of the rightwing group for a short time it was wonderful he told police in los angeles adl operative gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a factfinder to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups among other things he told san francisco

the article a lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as arabs things good and bad some of the falsehoods but the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with it is that everyone who serves in the cherry after a time goes in one way or another insane a man who said this who will here be called danny his full name is known to the editors served in the cherry after his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy his pal who will here be called dudu was also serving in the cherry and is now about to depart for a roundtheworld tour they both look no different from average israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service but in their souls one can notice something completely differentit was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them and they think that to most of their fellows from the cherry it woundn't be easy either yet after they began to talk it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking the following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness a short time ago i was in command of a veteran team in which some of the fellows applied for release from the cherry we called such soldiers hi 'hit by the intifada' under my command was a soldier who talked to himself nonstop which is a common phenomenon in the cherry i sent him to a psychiatrist but why i should talk about others when i myself feel quite insane on fridays when i come home my parents know i cannot be talked to until i go to the beach surf a little calm down and return the keys of my father's car must be ready for in advance so that i can go there i they dare talk to me before or whenever i don't want them to talk to me i just grab a chair and smash it instantly i know it is my nerve smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home to the car and to the beach only there i become normal another friday i was eating a lunch prepared by my mother it was an omelette of sorts she took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me i then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind i told her how i shot an arab and how exactly his wound looked like when i went to inspect it she began to laugh hysterically i wanted her to cry and she dared laugh straight in my face instead so i told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two arabs who were preparing the molotov cocktails he shot them down hitting them beautifully exactly as they deserved one bullet had set a molotov cocktail on fire with the effect that the arab was burning all over just beautifully i was delighted to see it my pal fired three bullets two at the arab with the molotov cocktail and the third at his chum it hit him straight in his ass we both felt that we'd pulled off something next i told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look i reached the spot first and then that arab blood gushing forth from his body spits at me i yelled 'shut up' and he dared talk back to me in hebrew so i just laughed straight in his face i am usually laughing when i stare at something convulsing right before my eyes then i told him 'all right wait a moment' i left him in order to take a look at another wounded arab i asked a soldier if that arab could be saved if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that i keep telling all this to my mother with details and she keeps laughing straight into my face this infuriated me i got very angry because i felt i was becoming mad so i stopped eating seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on and at once threw it over her head only then she stopped laughing at first she didn't know what to say but i must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently i went with a friend to practice shooting on a field a gull appeared right in the middle of the field my friend shot it at once then we noticed four deer standing high up on the hill above us my friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it we enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock we shot down two deer more and went to take a look when we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer badly wounded by our bullet but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother we carefully inspected two paths covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit we were just delighted by that sight we had hit'em so good then we decided to kill the young deer too so as spare it further suffering i approached took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance when you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in but my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us this made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness standing there soaked with blood we felt we were like beasts of prey we couldn't explain what had happened to us we were almost in tears while walking down from that hill and we felt the whole day very badly we always go back to places we carried out assignments in this is why we can see them when you see a guy you disabled may be for the rest of his life you feel you got power you feel godlike of sorts both danny and dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting dudu is not willing to work in any securitylinked occupation danny feels the exact opposite

here on sunday april NUM during the 2nd international meeting of solidarity with the armenian people and judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these political groups and organizations at least here in greece the armenian cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world the international meeting of solidarity was sponsored by the greek branch of the armenian popular movement a comparatively new political force headed by younger generations of armenians who openly profess their support of the armed struggle and of the armenian secret army for the liberation of armenia asala the organization has branches in various european and middle eastern countries and the united states although some of these branches appear to have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks of asala voicing the support of pasok the ruling party in greece to the armenian people was mr charalambidi michalis a member of the central

delivered by mr bassam abusalim on behalf of the popular front for the movement's continued support of the armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause pledging that palestinian operated and run training camps would always be open to armenian youth who need training for such a struggle later mr abusalim answering a question put to him by this writer affirmed that his organization had always trained armenian members of asala and that this policy will continue the doors of our camps are always open to armenian freedom fighters he affirmed among the prominent greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of prime minister papandreou who himself holds a post in the greek cabinet two members of the cypriot parliament who had journeyed to athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering representatives of the christian democratic party edik center party two wings of the communist party representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations a number of mayors of greek towns and cities two greek members of the european parliament and other members of the greek parliament were also among those who participated in the

the socialist progressive party of lebanon arab socialist labor party the kurdistan democratic union of iraq and numerous other international groups all noted for their radical stand in the israeli palestinian conflict support from arfrm among messages received from armenian groups was the armenian revolutionary federationrevolutionary movement the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers the message clearly gave its support to the armenian popular movement pledging that the revolutionary movement will continue to reveal the realities no matter how bitter or tragic they are to expose the antiarmenian activities of the leaders of the dashnag bureau the message was taken as an indication of the link loose as it may be that exists between the dissident dashnag group and the armenian popular movement open supporters of asala and armed struggle the armenian popular movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the greek capital known as neos kosmos where there is a large armenian presence the headquarters are located in a twostory building which appears to have

like christians to use force to convert to islam the nations which they brought under their power to which no one could have opposed today there would be no eastern problem but turks did not do so they obeyed the word of the koran to permit everybody to worship in their own way centuries before frederick the great pronounced his famous dictum thus in an age when the christian europe itself shed christian blood and when people in europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs the ottoman empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist where deaths at the stake were unheard of and where accusations of witchcraft were not made and the barbarian turkey was the only country where the jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the christians could find asylum these facts demonstrate that muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than christian countries1 the turks who are a conquering nation did not turkify the nations that came under their rule instead they respected their religions and traditions it was a stroke of luck for romania to live under turkish rule instead of russian or austrian rule because otherwise there would not have been a romanian nation today popescu ciocanel turks rule over people under their administration only externally without interfering with their internal structures on account of this the autonomy of minorities in turkey is better and more complete than any in the most advanced european countries2 human beings hate each other on account of religious differences this flaw is older than islam and christianity but there has never been any examples of this adjuration in turkey because turks never oppress anybody on account of his religion if enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of simple contempt among us too or if it did not keep translating itself into action many nations in our europe would probably have considered themselves happy a de mortraye3 turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition on the contrary it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of christian fanaticism if you look into history you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of jews who were expelled from spain and portugal found such a good asylum in turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of christians especially that of the orthodoxes no jew is able to appear in public during easter celebrations in athens even today in turkey however if the israelites are insulted by the greek and armenian communities local courts immediately take them under their protection in that vast and calm country of the sultan all religions and nations are living together peacefully although the mosque is superior to the church and the

young men usually aged between NUM to NUM years are members of the lebanese resistance even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to these young men are supported financially by iran most of the time they sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for israeli patrols every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians this a tried and true method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace thus forcing the opposing state to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or in order to avoid the deaths of civilians abandon the search certainly the people who use the population for cover are also to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm's way are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover israel should totally back down sothe easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives if israel insists that the so called security zone is necessary for the protection of northern israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers your damn right israel insists on some sort of demilitarized or buffer zone its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory of arab states and watched as the states did nothing it is not exactly surprizing that israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to do it themselves if israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from our land what so the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states can start all over again while i also hope for this to happen it will only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their soil they have to prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance towards antiisrael guerillas inresidence i have written before on this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled good lord brad what in the world goves you the idea that un troops stop anything they are only stationed in a country because that country allows them in it can ask them to leave at any time as nasser did in '56 and '67 somehow with that limitation on the troops powers i don't think that israel is going to be any more comfortable without a genuine commitment to peace from the arab states and concrete not intellectual or political exercises in jargon guarantees by other parties the un is worthless to israel but perhaps useful as a ruse this is the only realistic solution it is time for israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed in fact it has caused much more israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel would have resulted in perhaps you are aware that to most communities of people there is the feeling that it is better that many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently accept our fate ifhowever you call on israel to see the sense of suffering fewer casualties i suggest you apply the same to palestinian arab and islamic groups if israel really wants to save some israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the socalled security zone before the conclusion of the peace talks such a move would save israeli lives advance peace efforts give israel a great moral lift better israel's public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah be disarmed by the lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider retaking the buffer zone and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it from israel's perspective concessions gets it nothingexcept the realization that it has given something up and now can only hope that the other side decides to do likewise words can be taken back by merely doing so to take back tangible items land control of land requires the sort of action you say israel should stay away from israel put up with attacks from arab state territories for decades before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of lebanon the entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above NUM israel would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the arab state involved NUM that state promptly ignored the entire matter secure in the knowledge that it could not be held responsible for the acts committed by private groups NUM israel would prepare for the next round of attacks what would israel want to return to those days and don't be so idiotic as to suggest trust for the motivations of presentday arab states there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstances ah okwhat is different about the present situation that tells us that the arab states will not pursue their past antagonistic policies towards israel now don't talk about vague political factors but about those tangible just like that which israel gave up factors that guarantee the responsibility of those states your assessment of difference here is based on a whole lot of assumptions and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing and now the lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of lebanon basil it has not without the support and active involvement of syria lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred once syria

hojali is at last emerging in azerbaijan about NUM men women and children dead in the worst outrage of the fouryear war over nagorny karabakh the figure is drawn from azeri investigators hojali officials and casualty lists published in the baku press diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates the NUM february attack on hojali by armenian forces was one of the last moves in their fouryear campaign to take full control of nagorny karabakh the subject of a new round of negotiations in rome on monday the bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and a massacre but investigators say that most of the dead were civilians the awful number of people killed was first suppressed by the fearful former communist government in baku later it was blurred by armenian denials and griefstricken azerbaijan's wild and contradictory allegations of up to NUM dead the state prosecuter aydin rasulov the cheif investigator of a 15man team looking into what azerbaijan calls the hojali disaster said his figure of NUM people dead was a minimum on preliminary findings a similar estimate was given by elman memmedov the mayor of hojali an even higher one was printed in the baku newspaper ordu in may NUM dead people named and more than NUM bodies reported unidentified this figure of nearly NUM dead is quoted as official by leila yunusova the new spokeswoman of the azeri ministry of defence francois zen ruffinen head of delegation of the international red cross in baku said the muslim imam of the nearby city of agdam had reported a figure of NUM bodies received at his mosque from hojali most of them civilians we did not count the bodies but the figure seems reasonable it is no fantasy mr zen ruffinen said we have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead mr rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the number of dead in the massacre don't get worked up it will take several months to get a final figure the 43yearold lawyer said at his small office mr rasulov knows about these things it took him two years to reach a firm conclusion that NUM people were killed and NUM wounded when soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist uprising in baku in january NUM those nationalists the popular front finally came to power three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly what happened when hojali an azeri town which lies about NUM miles from the border with armenia fell to the armenians officially NUM people have so far been certified as dead being the number of people that could be medically examined by the republic's forensic department this is just a small percentage of the dead said rafiq youssifov the republic's chief forensic scientist they were the only bodies brought to us remember the chaos and the fact that we are muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within NUM hours of these NUM people NUM were women and NUM were children under NUM years old gunshots killed NUM people shrapnel killed NUM and axes or blunt instruments killed NUM exposure in the highland snows killed the last three thirtythree people showed signs of deliberate mutilation including ears noses breasts or penises cut off and eyes gouged out according to professor youssifov's report those NUM bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed mr rasulov said files from mr rasulov's investigative commission are still disorganised lists of NUM azeri militiamen are dead here six policemen there and in handwriting of a mosque attendant the names of NUM corpses brought to be washed in just one day the most heartbreaking account from NUM witnesses interviewed so far comes from towfiq manafov an azeri investigator who took a helicopter flight over the escape route from hojali on NUM february there were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to count properly NUM in hojali NUM people by the stream and the road and NUM visible around nakhchivanik village mr manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter pilot people waved up to us for help we saw three dead children and one twoyearold alive by one dead woman the live one was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up we tried to land but armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to return there has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in hojali at the time many inhabitants were displaced from other

karabakh at about 11pm a bombardment started such as we had never heard before eight or nine kinds of weapons artillery heavy machineguns the lot mr sadikov said soon neighbours were pouring down the street from the direction of the attack some huddled in shelters but others started fleeing the town down a hill through a stream and through the snow into a forest on the other side to escape the townspeople had to reach the azeri town of agdam about NUM miles away they thought they were going to make it until at about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two armenian villages of nakhchivanik and saderak none of my group was hurt up to then then we were spotted by a car on the road and the armenian outposts started opening fire mr sadikov said azeri militiamen fighting their way out of hojali rushed forward to force open a corridor for the civilians but their efforts were mostly in vain mr sadikov said only NUM people from his group of NUM made it through including his wife and militiaman son seven of his immediate relations died including his 67yearold elder brother i only had time to reach down and cover his face with his hat he said pulling his own big flat turkish cap over his eyes we have never got any of the bodies back the first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire one hero of the evacuation alif hajief was shot dead as he struggled to change a magazine while covering the third group's crossing mr sadikov said another hero elman memmedov the mayor of hojali said he and several others spent the whole day of NUM february in the bushy hillside surrounded by dead bodies as they tried to keep three armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay as the survivors staggered the last mile into agdam there was little comfort in a town

their death to that of athletes in munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder this exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth it seems to me dorin that you are so remote and ignorant of the problem on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation i will try to paint the most accurate picture i can of what the situation really is in south lebanon in article 1993apr1515245514555unocalcom stssdxbstunocalcom dorin baru writes is there any israeli a civilian in your opinion now i do not condone myself bombing villages any kind of villages but you claim these are villages with civilians and iraelis claim they are camps filled with terrorists you claim that israelis shell the villages with the 'hope' of finding a terrorist or so if they kill one fine if not too bad civilians die right i am not so sure i am i was back in my home village this last summer for your information we are people not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists most of the people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily business some work in the fields some own small shops others are older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee is that so hard to imagine it is not a terrorist camp as you and the israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc some young men usually aged between NUM to NUM years are members of the lebanese resistance even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to these young men are supported financially by iran most of the time they sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for israeli patrols every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians once they are back they announce that they bombed a terrorist hideout where an NUM year old girl just happened to be we are now accustomed to israeli tactics and we figure that this is the israeli way of telling us that if you're gonna hurt our soldiers you're gonna pay the price we accept this as a price we have to pay to free our land israel knows very well that it is not really hurting the resistance that much militarily with these strikes but rather just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young men to stop attacking israeli soldiers since these attacks are taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with the lebanese resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on occupying israeli soldiers until they withdraw this is the only real leverage that they have to force israel to withdraw the people of south lebanon are occupied or shelled by israel on a regular basis we do not want to be occupied if israel insists that the so called security zone is necessary for the protection of northern israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers if israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from our land we are not asking for the establishment of a lebanese occupied zone in northern israel to protect our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by israel so the best policy seems to be the removal of israeli occupation and the establishment of peace keeping troops along the border i have written before on this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled this is the only realistic solution it is time for israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed in fact it has caused much more israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel would have resulted in if israel really wants to save some israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the socalled security zone before the conclusion of the peace talks such a move would save israeli lives advance peace efforts give israel a great moral lift better israel's public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah be disarmed by the lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider retaking the buffer zone and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstances and now the lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of lebanon if you ask me those questions i will have no problem answering not with a question as you did no nobody is qualified candidate for murder nothing justifies murder i agree only in the case of the isareli soldiers their killing cannot be qualified as murder no matter what you say i have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make similar statements maybe after eliminating all israelis jews am i wrong yes we have no quarrel with

turkey had a democratic goverment and free press at that time forget about internal news agencies i haven't heard anything from any international source about any concentration camps with greek

only a short lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by usa to satisfy the internal greek loby i know what you would say next let me answer it before wasting anytime yes un had a few condemning resolutions against turkey because of handling the cyprus problem especially after the NUM coup well us and israel had a few too what can i say i am sure during athens junta duruing NUM greeks had their own share too closed matter today between turkish cypriotsturksgreeksgreek cypriots there is no more any official demand from greek cypriots about any missing greek cypriots where have you heard that there is no official demand regarding the missing persons have you looked at the latest un agenda for cyprus talks mediated by gali there was no issue whatsoever about any missing people among the negotiating parties was there i heard many times from denktas interviews by turkish and international press he keeps saying that this was no longer an issue for peace talks also you don't want me fish for the greek cypriot politician's words that argic had posted zillion times describing missing peoples as a greekcypriot myth seems that there is a different opinions among greekcypriots as well

cases of missing persons i know and i know quite a few are cases of people who were either in the reserve forces and were lost somewhere in the battlefield or were civilians who were taken prisoners

their own between july NUM and the final ceasefire in late august NUM this answer seems to satisfy the international community the un and the vasilu goverment since he did not make it an issue for the peace talks also i am not aware of any un condemnation against turkey about any missing greekcypriot are you btw do you mean that nicos sampson had a bloodless coup d'eta and nobody got hurt in those events as of the few photos which you refer to there are more than a few there are photos not only of greek cypriot soldiers being rounded up but also others in the prison camp in turkey like i said

power to the organs of the interim selfgovernment arrangements isga the isga will apply to the palestinian inhabitants of the territories under israeli military administration the arrangements will not have a territorial application nor will they apply to the israeli population of the territories or to the palestinian inhabitants of jerusalem residual powers not delegated under the isga will be reserved by israel israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects external internal and for the maintenance of public order the organs of the isga will be of an administrativefunctional nature the exercise of powers under the isga will be subject to cooperation and coordination with israel israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the areas of administration justice personnel agriculture education business tourism labor and social welfare local police local transportation and communications municipal affairs and religious affairs the palestinian counterproposal of march NUM the establishment of a palestinian interim selfgoverning authority pisga whose authority is vested by the palestinian people its pisga powers cannot be delegated by israel in the interim phase the israeli military government and civil adminis tration will be abolished and the pisga will asume the powers previous ly enjoyed by israel there will be no limitations on its pisga powers and responsibilities except those which derive from its character as an interim arrangement by the time pisga is inaugurated the israeli armed forces will have completed their withdrawal to agreed points along the borders of the occupied palestinian territory opt the opt includes jerusalem the jurisdiction of the pisga shall extend to all of the opt including its land water and air space the pisga shall have legislative powers to enact amend and abrogate laws it will wield executive power withput foreign control it shall determine the nature of its cooperation with any state or international body and shall be empowered to conclude binding coopera tive agreements free of any control by israel the pisga shall administer justice throughout the opt and will have sole and exclusive jruisdiction it will have a strong police force responsible for security and public order in the opt it can request the assistance of a un peacekeeping force disputes with israel over selfgoverning arrangements will be settled by a committee composed of representatives of the five permanent members of the un security council the secretary general of the un the pisga jordan egypt syria and israel but perhaps the bargaining attitude behind these very different visions of the interim stage is wrong for two reasons NUM the present palestinian and israeli leadership are as moderate as is likely to exist for many years so the present opportunity may be the last for a significant period NUM since these negotiations are not designed to or even attempting to resolve the conflict attention to issues dealing with a desired final status are mis placed and potentially destructive given this how should proposals from either side be altered to temper their maximalist approaches as stated above how can israeli worries and desire for some interim control be addressed while providing for a very real interim palestinian selfgoverning entity tim april NUM NUM response by al moore l629159lmsc5islmsclockheedcom basically the problem is that israel may remain or leave the occupied territories it cannot do both it cannot do neither so far israe continues to propose that they remain the palestinians propose that they leave why should either change their view it is worth pointing out that the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a reduction in the israeli presence israel proposes no such reduction and in fact may be said to not be negotiating tim there seem to be two perceptions that have to be addressed the first is that of israel where there is little trust for arab groups so there is little support for israel giving up tangible assets in exchange for pieces of paper expectations hopes etc the second is that of the arab worldpalestinians where there is the demand that these tangible concessions be made by israel without it receiving anything tangible back given this the gap between the two stances seems to be the need by israel of receiving some tangible returns for its expected concessions by tangible is meant something that NUM provides israel with comparable protection from the land it is to give up NUM in some way ensures that the arab states and palestine will be accountable and held actively not just diplomatically responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory by citizens or visitors in essence i do not believe that israel objections to palestinian statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now if israel was assured that any new palestinian state would be committed to coexisting with israel and held responsible for all attacks on israel from its territory aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above how could such guarantees be instilled for example how could such guaranteescontrols be added to the palestinian pisga proposals israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute it lets go gives lands back to arab states no more buffer zone gives full autonomy to palestinians any andor all of the arab parties could and would if not controlled somehow easily return to the traditional antiisrael position the question then is how to really ensure that that will not happen tim',\n",

conductor azerbaijani railroad resident at building NUM apartment NUM microdistrict no NUM sumgait azerbaijan i hadn't lived very long in sumgait only eight years i moved there from novosibirsk my son entered the baku nautical school and so i transferred to azerbaijan later i met someone and married him and now my name is arutunian my husband's name that there would be a massacre was not discussed openly but there were hints and gibes so to speak at the armenian people and they were mocking the russians too i was constantly aware of it at work and not just this past year i couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because i i'll just say it couldn't steal couldn't deceive and couldn't be involved in bribetaking and when i asked for decent working conditions they told me leave don't keep the others from working you aren't cut out for this kind of work and at work and around all the time i would hear gibes at the armenians like the turks had it right they killed them allthe way they've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live and things will be just fine if we get rid of them all no problem the turks will help they say if we ask them they'll rid armenia of armenians in half an hour well that's the way it all was but i never thought of course that it would spill over into a bloody tragedy because you just couldn't imagine it here we've been living under the soviet government for NUM years and no one even considered such an idea possible but i had been forming my own opinions and in the presence of authoritative people i would often ask where is this all leading do people really not see what kind of situation is emerging here the russians are fleeing sumgait there are very few of them left why is no one dealing with this what's going on and when it all happened on the 27th and 28th it became clear that everything had been arranged by someone because what else are you to make of it if the first secretary of the city party committee is marching ahead of the demonstration with an azerbaijani flag i wouldn't be saying this now if i hadn't received personal confirmation from him later because when we were under guard in the sk club on the 1st he came to the club that muslimzade the women told me there he is there he is that's muslimzade i didn't believe the rumors that he had carried an azerbaijani flag i thought that they were just false rumors i went over to him and said are you the first secretary of our city party committee he answers me yes and i ask him tell me did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an azerbaijani flag and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs i don't know exactly what they said but there was mention of armenian blood and he tells me yes i was there but i tried to dissuade them from it then i asked him another question and where were you when they were burning and slaughtering us and he said i we didn't know what to do we didn't know we didn't anticipate that that would happen in sumgait comrade mamedov the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers of the azerbaijani ssr answered the same question for me no we actually didn't anticipate the slaughter in sumgait at that time we were trying to contain the crowd of NUM in baku that was preparing for a massacre those are his exact words the ones he said in the office of the council of ministers of the armenian ssr and now about the events themselves of course it's painful to discuss them because it may seem that it's not true to someone else various rumors concerning what happened are making the rounds some are true others aren't but unfortunately there are more true ones than false because it was so horrible in our age here in the space age the age of science the age of progress i don't know if someone had told me this story if i were living in or around moscow i wouldn't have believed it why not because it was really a genocide it was a massacre that's genuinely what it was for example on that day the 28thi didn't know about the 27th because my husband and i were both sick both of us had the flu and we were in bedon the 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says you're in bed you don't know anything about it there was a demonstration in town and after it they were overturning armenian cars and burning them they were looking into cars and asking 'are you an armenian' if they answered in armenian then they turned the car over and burned it this isn't made up the wife of the senior investigator of the baku ministry of internal affairs told us he was returning home from his dacha with his wife raisa sevastyanova she's my neighbor she immediately came and told lis that they had landed right in the middle of it i don't know what to call it the cavalcade of automobiles they were stopping he answered in azerbaijani they let them go but they made him honk the horn they were kicking up a fracas we didn't even believe it and i said certainly that didn't happen how can that be and she said muslimzade was leading the crowd and the sputnik store was completely smashed because most of the salespeople there are armenians and when he saw that they had started breaking the glass in that store he said don't break the shop windows don't destroy state property but do whatever else you want i didn't hear this with my own two ears but it is a fact that the store was torn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing armenians although he's an azerbaijani while we were talking all of a sudden right across from us sevastyanova is the first to look out the window and say look there's a crowd out there and sure enough when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had already started wrecking the neighboring building there was an armenian family there a woman and two girls they lived across from us i'm sorry i don't know the building number or the people's names since we were in my husband's apartment in microdistrict NUM and i lived in microdistrict no NUM there was awful looting going on there at the time the most hideous things were going on there then one building there ours was attacked twice once wasn't enough for them they returned to the places where they hadn't finished the armenians off if an azerbaijani family dared to conceal armenians they beat the azerbaijanis too they also beat russians if it was russians doing the hiding because there were russians among them they said so on television there were people of various nationalities but they didn't tell us why there were people of different nationalities because they wouldn't have touched the azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes at the time i saw this from the window i was there sevastyanova was there and so was my husband we went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly off a balcony all kinds of things even a sofa then when it was all down there they burned it up then we saw the crowd and they were all oohing at first i couldn't figure out what was happening and later i told my husband lendrush l think they're beating someone out there and he answered i don't know could be suddenly the crowd separated for a moment and i saw it and raisa sevastyanova saw it too my husband had turned the other way he didn't see it i saw a naked girl with her hair down they were dragging her she kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her she fell down it was muddy there and later other witnesses who saw it from their balconies told us they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of blocks as far as the mortgage bank that's a good block and a half or two from here i know this for sure because i saw it myself then the crowd rushed toward our building we were standing there and you can of course imagine what we were feeling were they going to kill us or not and i also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented that woman because i had just seen that i asked my husband i gave him an axe and said you kill me first and then let them do what they want with the corpse but our neighbors it's true defended us they said there aren't any armenians in our entryway go away only muslims live here disaster missed us that time but at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about NUM people approximately came back to our place my husband was already asleep he can sleep when he's upset about something but i can't i was standing running from balcony to balcony our power was out i don't remember for how long but it was as though it had been deliberately turned off there were no lights whatsoever and i was glad of course i thought it was better that way but then i look and the crowd is at our balcony this was at NUM in the morning the first time they were at our building it was NUM and now it was NUM in the morning but i never thought that that old woman on the first floor the azerbaijani was awake and watching out there were human beings among them too so she goes out with a pail of garbage as though she needed to be taking garbage out at two o'clock in the morning she used it as a pretext and went toward those young people they really were youngsters from my balcony you could see perfectly that they were young azerbaijani boys they spoke azerbaijani and when they came up to her she said what do you want and they answered we want the armenian family that lives here pointing toward the second floor with their hands she says i already told you we don't have any armenians here now leave do you hear this is an old muslim woman talking to you and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around her and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away and so they seemed to listen to her they were all very young they started apologizing and left that was the second time death was at our door i forgot to mention about one other apartment a man named rubik lives there i don't know him really i knew his daughter i mean i saw her around but we really didn't know them but i do know that that guy who lives on the fourth floor across from our entryway went to chernobyl and worked there for eight months to earn money can you imagine what that means he risked his life to earn x amount of money in order to better his family he bought new furniture and was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage but alas everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels they threw everything out the windows and the rest we saw from our balcony how the neighbors on the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that hadn't already been smashed or taken what is one to think of that it means that the parents in those families were in on it too unfortunately i came to be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been foreseen in advance both the beating of the armenians and the stripping of apartments something on the order of we'll move the armenians out and take over their apartments i have worked honestly my whole life you can check everything about me i came as a patriot from china waited for nights on end in front of the consulate general of the ussr i came to my homeland as a patriot because i knew that the party and the komsomol were holy things but when i saw in sumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them that party membership was bought that komsomol members joined only for personal gain that there were no ideals no ideas god save me everything was being bought and sold i saw all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did i can't talk any more about it the image of that beating when i went out of my own apartmentthey picked us up under soviet army guard they had arrived from all over to suppress that gangnot only armenians but some russian families and their children too came out of their apartments and joined us because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with the situation the way it was and what's interesting is that when we left on the buses i rode and thought that at least one group of people for sure people would basically rise to the situation would have some compassion for the armenians would somehow understand the injustice of what was done but having analyzed and weighed the whole thing once i calmed down having thought it all through i came to a conclusion that is shared by many people if a lot of azerbaijanis didn't want their armenian neighbors to be killed and that basically depended on that muslimzadehe said that he had wanted to calm them downthen is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom he could whisper at the last minute go and announce it on television citizens of sumgait take what you can into your hands let's protect our neighbors from this massacre those crowds weren't such that there was no controlling them basically they were unarmed they didn't have firearms mostly they had knives they had all kinds of metal parts like armature shafts sharpened at the ends special rocks different to a degree that we noticed them there aren't rocks like those in sumgait soils they were brought from somewhere as though it were all specially planned so as i was saying i weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend us why wasn't it arranged it means that the government didn't want to do it when the crowd was moving from the city party committee to the sputnik what there was no way of informing baku no there was no way it turns out the crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict i won't mention the things i didn't see myself i'll only talk about the things i myself witnessed they were in microdistrict NUM beginning at NUM o'clock in the evening when i saw them from the other building and they were somewhere else until midnight or one o'clock in the morning because at NUM they came back to our building they hadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of microdistrict NUM when they returned to our building i told my husband lendrush now the police are probably going to come my god now the authorities are probably going to find out and come to our aid well alas no there were to be no authorities not a single policeman not a single fireman not a single ambulance came while they were raging as it turns out as we later found out beginning on the might of the 27th there were dead people ruined apartments and burned autos one car near the bus station it was burned and overturned it was probably there about four days everyone saw it and what went on in block NUM those who live there know they saw from their balconies how they attacked the soldiers in the buses how they beat those poor unarmed soldiers and how on that square i can't remember the name of it where there is that fork coming from the bus station that intersection now i'm upset and i can't think of the name there's a tall building there a 9story and from the balconies there people saw that butchery when the poor soldiers wearing only helmets with shields and those unfortunate clubs moved against that mob and when they fell those 12to 14yearold boys ran up and using stones big heavy stones beat them to death on their heads who could have guessed that something like that could happen in the soviet union and under the soviet government the upshot is that this republic has not been under soviet control for a long time but no one wanted to pay any attention or get involved if you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that i tell the truth i've been struggling for truth for five years there already the five years that i worked at the azerbaijani railroad some people there considered me a demagogue others who knows what some think i'm an adventure seeker and some a prankster but i wanted everything to be right i would become outraged how can this be why is it people treat one another this way on a soviet railroad as though the azerbaijani railroad were azerbaijani property or the property of some magnate or some mafia if i want to i'll get you out of here if i want to i'll get rid of you if i want to i'll do something else and there's a black market price for everything in the most brazen way a coach to moscow costs so much a coach on a local train costs so much once when i was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool he had the nerve to tell me maybe you won't even believe this but this i'm afraid i heard with my own ears tatyana just how long can you fight for something that you know will never have any effect you're alone against everyone so instead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor and everything will go fine for you i started to cry turned and left what else could i do where else could i go to complain i realized that everything was useless and the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see it i filed a written complaint and they ground it into dust they destroyed it i still have a copy but what's the use when the general procuracy got involved with the investigation of the bloody sumgait affair in addition to the information about what i saw what i was a witness to i gave testimony about the mafia at the railroad they accepted my petition but i don't know if they're going to pursue it or not because you'll excuse me i no longer believe in the things i aspired to the things i believed in before it's all dead they just spit on my soul stomped on everything physically and most important spiritually because you can lose belongings that's nonsense that all comes with time but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in youyour beliefsare destroyed it can be very difficult to restore them i want to tell of one incident i just don't know at the time i was in such a state that i didn't even take minor things into account here is an example of course it's not a minor one my neighbor raisa sevastyanova she has a son valery who is in the 9th grade in a school in microdistrict NUM a boy vitaly danielian i don't know his last name goes to school with him or rather went to school with him i was just sitting in an apartment trying to make a phone call to moscow oh yes and there's one important detail when the massacre began for two to three hours the phones weren't working in armenian apartments and later in several russian and azerbaijani apartments but the fact of the matter is that service was shut off you could not call anywhere why again it means it was all planned how come service is cut off for no reason and the lights went off and those brats were raging as they liked they weren't afraid they ran about freely they that no one would slap their hands and no one would dare to stop them they knew it now i'm going to tell about the incident so this little vitaly vitalik an armenian boy went to school with valery they were in the same class according to what valery and his neighbor pal saidat the time i was in the same apartment as they were i sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put througha mob attacked the building where vitalik lived so valery ran to his mother and said mamma please let me go to vitalik's what if they kill him maybe he's still alive maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow he's a nice guy we all like him he's a good person he's smart his mother wouldn't let him go in tears she says valery you can't go because i am afraid he says mamma we can get around the crowd we'll just watch just have a look they made it through i don't know i think vitalik's parents lived in microdistrict no NUM and when they got there they made a superficial deduction knowing that balconies and doors were being broken everywhere that you could see from the street which were the armenian apartments in the building they went here and there and looked and saw that the windows were intact and so they calmed down but even though the windows in that apartment were not broken everything inside was totally smashed and vitalik lay there with a broken skull and his mother and father had already been murdered little vitalik didn't even know they were dead so two weeks ago i don't know he was in critical condition no maybe it was longer we left sumgait on march NUM spent some time in moscow and then we came to yerevan so it's been about a month already it's so hard to keep all this straight so valery the next day when he found out that vitalik's family has been killed and vitalik was ling in the semashko hospital in baku valery and his classmates got together and went to visit him but they wouldn't admit them telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in a coma they cried and left having also found out that the girl i saw being kicked and dragged was in that hospital too as it turns out she was brought there in serious condition but at least she was alive at the time when we got to the sk club we would see first one friend and then another throw ourselves into their arms and kiss them because you had wondered if these friends were alive or not if those friends were alive or not and when you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived when you saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end if you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book a book of things it is even difficult to believe and those two girls who were raped were entirely black and blue the ones at the sk they know i'm not lying that girlfriend came up to one of them and said what happened and she bared her breasts and they were completely covered in cigarette burns those rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts after something like that i don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it now when we stayed at the military unit for a while they provided well basic conditions for us there the military unit is located in nasosny some six miles from sumgait and living there we met with a larger group of people there were about NUM people at the unit you know there was a point when i couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw so much heartbreak around you and when you hear the false rumors yes by the way false rumors were spread in sumgait saying that the armenians around yerevan had destroyed azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground with bulldozers i didn't know whether to believe it or not and people who don't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge but when i arrived in armenia and was in spitak and in spitak all those villages are not only intact but at that time had even been protected just in case they were guarded they got better food than did the inhabitants of spitak not a single person there died and no one is planning to harm them around yerevan all the villages are safe and unharmed and the armenians didn't attack anyone but actually after an evil of the magnitude suffered in sumgait there could have been a feeling of vengefulness but no one acted on it and i don't know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the armenians are guilty that it is they who organized it rumors like that are being spread in azerbaijan and if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it they not only perceive it with their minds but with their hearts too to them it seems that the older person is telling the truth for example one says did you know that out of NUM people killed by the way originally they said NUM people but later they found a 32nd NUM were azerbaijani and one was an armenian of course i'm upset but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and not become upset sometimes l forget things but i know i want to return to the time when we were in the sk club across from the city party committee when i saw muslimzade in the sk club building i went to him to ask because i couldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner i already mentioned this and if i repeat anything please excuse me i asked him why did you do that and why are you here now why did you come here to laugh at these women who are strewn about on the floor the overcrowding there was tremendous it was completely unsanitary and several of the children were already sick it's true the troops tried to make it livable for us they cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food but the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at it everywhere that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere plus they were never given any direct orders they didn't know what they were authorized to do and not to do and it was only on march NUM at five o'clock in the evening that krayev himself the lieutenant general the city commandant of sumgait was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do as his heart advised him and relocate people to the military unit but that's not what i want to talk about now muslimzade characteristically tried to get me out of the sk building and take me to the city party committee which is across the square from the club he took me by the hand and said citizen don't worry we'll go and have a talk in my office i told him no after everything you've done i don't believe one iota of what you say if i go to the city party committee i'll disappear and the traces of me will disappear too because you can't stand it when oh yes and there was another interesting detail from that meeting it was even very funny although at the time i wasn't up to laughing he was in a nice expensive hat and so as to put him to shame so to speak i said oh why did you come here all duded up like a london dandy you smell of good perfume you're in your starched shirt and you have your expensive hat on you came to ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor who are already getting sick whose relatives have died did you come to laugh at them and the one who was accompanying him an azerbaijani i don't know who he was or what his title was he quickly snatched the hat off muslimzade's head and hid it then i said my god we're not marauders we're not you we didn't come to you with the intention of stealing well kill me kill me muslimzade says to me but i'm not guilty kill me kill me but i'm not guilty and i say ok fine you're not guilty have it your way but give us an answer we're asking you where were you when they were torturing and raping those poor women when they were killing the children burning things carrying on outrageously and wrecking all those apartments where were you then you know we didn't expect it we did not know what to do we didn't anticipate that something like that would happen in sumgait i started laughing and said it's truly funny he says what could i do we didn't know what to do and i say i'm sorry but it'll be ridiculous if i tell you the first secretary of the city party committee shouldn't march out in front with a banner he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross over his dead body that's what you should have done that's the way it was during the war not a single party committee secretary compromised himself either he died or he led people into battle and what did you do you ran away you left you hid you marched with a flag because you were afraid excuse my language you feared for your own damned hide and when we ask you you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done that's right i told him the city party committee got confused all the party committees got confused the police got confused baku got confused they all lay in a faint for two weeks and the gang ran the show with impunity and if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two days there wouldn't be a single armenian left in sumgait for sure they would have finished their bloody affair because they brazenly went up to some russians too the ones who tried to say something to them and they told them 'as soon as we finish with the armenians we'll come after you too and by the way there was a colonel who took us to the military unit he was the one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later arrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the sk and took us to the military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit we asked him what how what will come of us he openly said you know for us the main thing now is to catch that gang we'll finish that quickly you'll stay at the military unit for the time being and we'll decide later the general procuracy of the ussr arrived it consists of investigators from all cities there were some from stavropol from everywhere just everywhere because the affair was truly frightful about this by the way comrade katusev spoke as everyone knows he's the first deputy general procurator of the ussr when he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit by the way he told us the honest truth because he couldn't not say it because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen and he said there was afghanistan and it was bad but sumgaitit's horrible and the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely punished in accordance with our laws and that's a quote then one mother throws herself at himher two sons had died before her very eyesand says who will return my sons who is going to punish the culprits they tried to calm her down and he said in order for us to conduct a proper investigation in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility you must help us because we don't know maybe there was someone else in the gang who is now being concealed in homes and maybe the neighbors know maybe someone saw something don't be afraid write about it in detail so that you're not afraid everyone knows that many of you are afraid having lived through such horrors they think that if they write the whole truth about let's say their neighbor or someone else that they will seek revenge later we're going to do it like this we're going to set up an urn and you can throw what you write in there we don't need to know who wrote it the names of the people who write won't be made public but we need all the information let each and every one not be afraid let each write what is necessary who they saw in that gang who made threats or shouted threatening gibes about the armenians you must describe all of these people and put the information into the urn two soldiers and a major guarded the urn and sure enough many people people who didn't even want to write i know one woman who asked me she came up and said you as a russian the same thing won't happen to you as will happen to me so please i'll give you the information and you please write it down for me so she was afraid and there were a lot like her but later after katusev made his speech she sat and wrote down everything she knew and we threw it all into the urn now we don't know if it will be of any use for a factual picture will emerge from all that information one person can lie but thousands can't lie thousands simply can't lie you have to agree with that a fact is a fact why for example should someone say that black is white if it is really black the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers of the azerbaijani ssr mamedov as i said was in yerevan my husband and i were at the council of ministers of the armenian ssr and found out that mamedov was present the one who had come to convince the people of sumgait to return to their previous dwellings to their old apartments we asked for a meeting with him and it was granted when we went to see him he tried to behave properly very politely delicately but when the truth was told right to his face and when i asked him some of the same questions i had asked muslimzade where were you personally when they were beating us now you're trying to convince us to return why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where it was all leading he says you're telling the truth let's not mince words you've told me right to my face and i'll tell you straight i'll tell you the pure truth i was gotten out of bed in the evening the whole government was up including me and we were restraining a crowd of about NUM in baku but we never expected that in a city like sumgait with its fine international record such a thing could happen we expected it in baku i say so that means you expected it all the same why were you expecting it and he says you know it just happened that way we were expecting it in baku we were trying to restrain it but in sumgait i say fine you didn't know for the first three or four hours but then you should have known why did no one help us and he says well ok we didn't know what to do and things like that basically it was the same story i got from muslimzade later when he said you go on back the situation in sumgait is favorable now everything is fine the armenians are friendly with the azerbaijanis to this l answered you know what i'm speaking with you as a member of a neutral nation i have never argued with armenians or with azerbaijanis and i was an eyewitness you tell me please comrade mamedov i asked him what would you say about this honestly if you were being completely frank with us then he said yes i admit that i am honestly ashamed shame on the entire azerbaijani nation we have disgraced ourselves not only before the entire soviet union but before the whole world because now the voice of america and all the other foreign radio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors too and i say there's nothing to add to what really happened i don't think it's possible to add anything more awful he says yes i agree with you i understand your pain it is truly an unfortunate occurrence i repeat that he said unfortunate occurrence and then he suddenly remembered himself what he was sayinghe had a pen in his hands he was fidgeting with it nervously and said oh excuse me a tragedy really i take this to mean that he really thinks it's an unfortunate occurrence and of course he says i understand that having gone through all this you can't return to sumgait but it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being tried and he even gave a detail which i don't know if it matters or not that NUM policemen were being tried specifically in relation to that bloody affair yes by the way there is another good detail how i was set up at work in baku after the events i went to an undergarment plant there was an azerbaijani working there and suddenly she tells me what they didn't nail your husband they screwed up i was floored i hadn't imagined that anyone in baku too could say something like that well after that i went up to see to my office i needed to find out about those days what was going to happen with them how they were going to put down those days from february NUM to march NUM and the administrator told me i don't know tatyana go to the head of the conductors' pool be grateful if they don't put it down as unexcused absence i was really discouraged by this they all know that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived and here they're telling me that i was skipping work as though i was off enjoying myself somewhere i went to the office of the chief of the pool his last name is rasulov and he's had that position for many years incidentally he's a party member and is a big man in town and suddenly when i went to him and said comrade rasulov this is the way it was he looked at me askance and said and why are youhe knows me by my previous last namewhy did you get wrapped up in this mess i say what do you mean why did i get wrapped up in this mess my husband's an armenian i tell him i have an armenian last name and he screwed up his face made a kind of a grimace as though he had eaten something sour and said i didn't expect that you would what did he mean by that and how should he behave the chief of the pool a man who supervises NUM workers now it's true there was a reduction but for sure there are still NUM conductors working for him and if someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that then what can you expect from a simple uneducated politically unsophisticated person he's going to believe any and all rumors that the armenians are like this the armenians are like that and so on by the way that mamedovnow i'm going back to mamedov's office when i asked him are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return to sumgait he answered yes you know i would guarantee them i don't want to take on too much i would guarantee them firmly for NUM years but i won't guarantee them for longer than NUM years i say so you've got another thing like that planned for NUM years from now so they'll be quiet and then in another NUM years it'll happen again i couldn't contain myself any more and i also told him and how did it get to that point certainly you knew about it how they were treating the russians for example in baku and in sumgait how they were hounded from their jobs certainly you received complaints i wrote some myself why did no one respond to them why did everyone ignore what was going on didn't you prepare people for this by the way you treated them and he says you know you're finally starting to insult me he threw his pen on the desk maybe now you'll say i'm a scoundrel too i say you know i'm not talking about you because i don't know but about the ones who i do know i can say with conviction yes that comrade was involved in this that and that because i know for certain well anyway he assured us that here in yerevan there were false rumors that NUM sumgait armenians were here and NUM were in sumgait and had gotten back to work everyone was working he said and life was very good we drove about the town ourselves comrade arutiunian first secretary of the communist party of armenia ssr came from the council of ministers of armenian he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in sumgait when i asked mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said ' well i walked down the street and i said walking down the street in any city even if i were to go to new york i would never understand the situation because i would be a guest i don't have any contact with people but if you spend NUM days among some bluecollar workers in such a way that they didn't know you were the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers you'd hear something quite different i told him for example that i drew my conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments they took us all in turns to pick things up since people had fled to the military unit they got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible how are the neighbors in the microdistrict how will they view us what do they think i thought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general of a mass nature some antinational something and when that bus took us to our building because it was the same bus while we were going up to our apartment an armed soldier accompanied us what does that say it speaks of the fact that if everything there were fine why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with us going from apartment to apartment and in fact especially with the young people you could sense the delight at our misfortune the grins and they were making comments too and that was in the presence of troops when police detachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and tanks were passing by and if people are taking such malicious delight when the situation is like that then what is it going to be like when they withdraw protection from the city altogether there will be more outrages of course perhaps

that the hollering kills the spirit of the criminalnazi armenians of the asalasdpaarf terrorism and revisionism triangle now try dealing with the rest of what i wrote what is more the activities of the armenian government seem to have been efforts aimed at eradicating a race the turks or aimed at carrying out a onesided feud instead of being a struggle for liberation from the outset the efforts of the armenian revolutionaries within the ottoman borders took the form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder cruelty and genocide so that no other interpretation of them is possible armenian activities started during the reign of abdulhamid ii as individual acts of terror and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks the element of brute force in these activities increased steadily culminating in mass rebellions and widespread fighting during the first world war furthermore when the ottoman army withdrew from eastern anatolia after the NUM sarikamis defeat armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area although the russians occupied eastern anatolia as an enemy nevertheless they were constrained by the rules of war however when they returned to their country in NUM after the revolution armenian revolutionaries were unchecked in this area for about a year until the ottoman forces returned to erzurum in NUM during this period armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on the local people which is recorded in historical documents1 for example let us look at a report dated NUM march NUM which the commander of the third army submitted when he entered erzurum and erzincan they were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down by armenians even the trees were cut down and they are like a building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word as for the people who had been living in erzurum and erzincan those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning with the excuse of forced labor in road construction they were taken in the direction of sarikamis and annihilated when the russian army withdrew a part of the remaining people was destroyed in armenian massacres and cruelties they were thrown into wells they were locked in houses and burned down they were killed with bayonets and swords in places selected as butchering spots their bellies were torn open their lungs were pulled out and girls and women were hanged by their hair after being subjected to every conceivable abominable act a very small part of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to including women and children such persons discovered so far do not exceed one thousand five hundred in erzincan and thirty thousand in erzurum all the fields in erzincan and erzurum are untilled everything that the people had has been taken away from them and we found them in a destitute situation at the present time the people are subsisting on some food they obtained impelled by starvation from russian storages left behind after their occupation of this area2 foreign observers who witnessed the events including russian officers who did not desert their lines submitted detailed reports proving the genocide to ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war what is most important is that they stated in their reports 'the massacres did

a group of california residents filed suit wednesday charging the antidefamation league of b'nai brith with violating their privacy by spying on them for the israeli and south african governments the

towards the occupied territories and south africa's apartheid policy the adl refused to comment on the suit the suit also took aim at two top local adl officials and retired san francicso police officer tom gerard claiming they violated privacy guarantees in the state constitution and violated state confidentiality laws according to the suit gerard helped the adl obtain access to confidential files in law enforcement and government computers information from these files were passed to the foreign governments the suit charges the whole concept of an organized collection of information based on political viewpoints and using government agencies as a source of information is absolutely repugnant said former rep pete mccloskey who is representing the plaintiffs the adl's informationgathering network was revealed publicly last week when the san francisco district attorney's office released documents indicating the group had spied on NUM people and NUM political and

investigate said arens a research scientist at the university of southern california the adl believes that anyone who is arab americanor speaks politically against israel is at least a closet antisemite the fbi and the district attorney's office have been investigating the operation for four months the NUM plaintiffs in the case include arens the son of former israeli defense minister

unconventional proposal for peace in the middleeast by elias davidsson the following proposal is based on the following assumptions NUM fundamental human rights such as the right to life to education to establish a family and have children to human dignity the right to free movement to free expression etc are more important to human existence that the rights of states NUM in the event of a conflict between basic human rights and rights of collectivities basic human rights should prevail NUM between the collectivities defining themselves as jewishisraeli and palestinianarab however labelled an unresolved conflict exists NUM this conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of people it moreover poisons relations between communities peoples and nations NUM each year the united states expends billions of dollars in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties NUM attempts to solve the israeliarab conflict by traditional political means have failed NUM as long as the conflict is perceived as that between two distinct ethnicalreligious communitiespeoples which claim the land there is no just nor peaceful solution possible NUM love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake of peace and justice when people love they share having stated my assumptions i will now state my proposal NUM a fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is israelijew and the other palestinianarab NUM to be entitled for a grant a couple will have to prove that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to israeli citizenship under the law of return and the other partner although born in areas under current isreali control is not entitled to such citizenship under the law of return NUM for the first child the grant will amount to NUM for the second the third child NUM for each child for each subsequent child the grant will amount to NUM for each child NUM the fund would be financed by a variety of sources which have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the israeliarab conflict including the us government jewish and christian organizations in the us and a great number of governments and international organizations NUM the emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed' marriages in israelpalestine all of whom would have relatives on 'both sides' of the divide would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society the existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of people would also help the integration of israeli society into the middleeast in a graceful manner objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced i will attempt to identify some of these NUM the idea of providing financial incentives to selected forms of partnership and marriage is not conventional however it is based on the concept of affirmative action which is recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effects of segregation and discrimination international law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at reducing racial discrimination and segregation NUM it may be objected that the israelipalestinian conflict is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict but that it is a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed struggle this objection is based on the assumption that the 'enemy' is not zionism as ideology and practice but israelijewish society and its members which will have to be defeated this objection has no merit because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental human rights over collective rights see above NUM fundamentalist jews would certainly object to the use of financial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages' from their point of view the continued existence of a specific jewish people overrides any other consideration be it human love peace of human rights the president of the world jewish congress edgar bronfman reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he gave to der spiegel a german magazine he called the increasing assimilation of jews in the world a calamity comparable in its effects only with the holocaust this objection has no merit either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions see above NUM it may objected that only a few people in israelpalestine would request such grants and that it would thus not serve its purpose to this objection one might respond that although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal the existence of such a fund would help mixed couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist attitudes NUM it may objected that such a fund would need great sums to bring about substantial demographic changes this objection has merits however it must be remembered that huge sums more than NUM billion are expended each year by the united states government and by us organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the middleeast through armaments a mere fraction of these sums would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in israelpalestine thus encouraging the emergence of a nonsegregated society in that worntorn land i would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful discussion and

that day february NUM we were at home of course we had heard that there was unrest in town my younger brother aleksandr had told us about it but we didn't think we thought that everything would happen outdoors that they wouldn't go into people's apartments about five o'clock we saw a large crowd near the kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict we were sitting at home watching television we go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into mir street this is right near downtown next to the airline ticket office our house is right nearby that day there was a group of policeman with shields there they threw rocks at those policemen then they moved off in the direction of our building they burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and started shouting for armenians to come out of the building we switched off the light as it turns out their signal was just the opposite to turn on the light that meant that it was an azerbaijani home we of course didn't know and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment suddenly there's pounding on the door we go to the door all four of us there were four of us in the apartment father mother my younger brother aleksandr and i he was born in NUM my father was a veteran of world war ii and had fought in china and in the soviet far east he was a pilot we went to the door and they started pounding on it harder breaking it down with axes we start to talk to them in azerbaijani what's going on what's happened they say armenians get out of here we don't open the door we say if we have to leave we'll leave we'll leave tomorrow they say no leave now get out of here armenian dogs get out of here by now they've broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides we hold them off as best we can my father and i on one side and my mother and brother on the other we had prepared ourselves we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves they broke in the door and when the door gave way we held it for another halfhour no neighbors no police and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time we held the door they started to smash the door on the lock side first with an axe and then with a crowbar when the door gave waythey tore it off its hingessasha hit one of them with the axe the axe flew out of his hands they also had axes crowbars pipes and special rods made from armature shafts one of them hit my father in the head the pressure from the mob was immense when we retreated into the room one of them hit my mother too in the left part of her face my brother sasha and i fought back of course sasha is quite strong and hottempered he was the judo champion of sumgait we had hammers in our hands and we injured several of the banditsin the heads and in the eyes all that went on but they the injured ones fell back and others came to take their places there were many of them the door fell down at an angle the mob tried to remove the door so as to go into the second room and to continue to finish us off father brought skewers and gave them to sasha and mewe flew at them when we saw father bleeding his face was covered with blood he had been wounded in the head and his whole face was bloody we just threw ourselves on them when we saw that we threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall drove them down to the third floor we came out on the landing but a group of the bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in there having closed the door behind them we started tearing the door off to chase away the remaining ones or finish them then a man an imposing man of about NUM an azerbaijani came in when he was coming in father fell down and mother flew to him and started to cry out i jumped out onto the balcony and started calling an ambulance but then the mob started throwing stones through the windows of our veranda and kitchen we live on the fourth floor and no one came i went into the room it seemed to me that this man was the leader of the group he was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a fur collar and he addressed my mother in azerbaijani what's with you woman why are you shouting what happened why are you shouting like that she says what do you mean what happened you killed somebody my father was a musician he played the clarinet he played at many weddings armenian and azerbaijani he played for many years everyone knew him mother says the person who you killed played at thousands of azerbaijani weddings he brought so much joy to people and you killed that person he says you don't need to shout stop shouting and when they heard the voice of this man the NUM to NUM people who were in the other room opened the door and started running out we chased after them but they ran away that man left too as we were later told downstairs one of them told the others i don't know if it was from fright or what told them that we had firearms even though we only fought with hammers and an axe we raced to father and started to massage his heart but it was already too late we asked the neighbors to call an ambulance the ambulance never came although we waited for it all evening and all through the night somewhere around midnight about NUM policemen came they informed us they were from khachmas they said we heard that a group was here at your place you have our condolences they told us not to touch anything and left father lay in the room so we stayed home each of us took a hammer and a knife we sat at home well we say if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves somewhere around one o'clock in the morning two people came from the sumgait procuracy investigators they say leave everything just how it is we're coming back here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything then people came from the republic procuracy too but no one helped us take father away the morning came and the neighbors arrived we wanted to take father away somehow we called the procuracy and the police a couple of times but no one came we called an ambulance and nobody came then one of the neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should hide we secured the door somehow or other we left father in the room and went up to the neighbor's the excesses began again in the morning the bandits came in several vehicles zil panel trucks and threw themselves out of the vehicles like a landing force near the center of town our building was located right there a crowd formed then they started fighting with the soldiers then in buildings NUM and NUM that's next to the airline ticket office they started breaking into armenian apartments destroying property and stealing the armenians weren't at home they had managed to flee and hide somewhere and again they poured in the direction of our building they were shouting that there were some armenians left on the fourth floor meaning us they're up there still up there let's go kill them they broke up all the furniture remaining in the two rooms threw it outside and burned it in large fires we were hiding one floor up something heavy fell sasha threw himself toward the door shouting that it was probably father they had thrown father were defiling the corpse probably throwing it in the fire going to burn it i heard it and the sound was kind of hollow and i said no that's from some of the furniture mother and i pounced on sasha and stopped him somehow and calmed him down the mob left somewhere around eight o'clock they smashed open the door and went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us they were also armenians they had left for another city the father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said are you crazy why are you hiding armenians don't you now they're checking all the apartments they could kill you and them and to us come on leave this apartment we went down to the third floor to some other neighbors' at first the man didn't want to let us in but then one of his sons asked him and he relented we stayed there until eleven o'clock at night we heard the sound of motors the neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers we went downstairs there was a light on in the room where we left father in the other rooms as we found out later all the chandeliers had been torn down they left only one bulb the bulb was burning which probably was a signal they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our microdistrict NUM where there had been a pogrom with the help of the soldiers we made it to the city party committee and were saved our salvationmy mother's my brother's and minewas purely accidental because as we later found out from the neighbors someone in the crowd shouted that we had firearms up there well we fought but we were only able to save mother we couldn't save father we inflicted many injuries on the bandits some of them serious but others came to take their places we were also wounded there was blood and we were scratched all overwe got our share it was a miracle we survived we were saved by a miracle and the troops and if troops hadn't come to sumgait the slaughter would have been even greater probably all the armenians would have been victims of the genocide through an acquaintance at the city party committee i was able to contact the leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city and at their orders we were assigned special people to accompany us experts we went to ' pick up father's corpse we took it to the morgue this was about two o'clock in the morning it was already march NUM it was raining very hard and it was quite cold and we were wearing only our suits when my brother and i carried father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses there were about six burned people in there and the small corpse of a burned child it was gruesome i suffered a tremendous shock there were about ten people there but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being taken to baku there was a woman's corpse there too she had been well there was part of a body there a hackedoff part of a woman's body it was something terrible the morgue was guarded by the landing force the child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old it was impossible to tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned there was a man there too several men you couldn't tell anything because their faces were disfigured they were in such awful condition now two and a half months have passed every day i recall with horror what happened in the city of sumgait every day my father and the death of my father and how we fought and the people's sorrow and especially the morgue i still want to say that NUM years have passed since soviet power was established and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what happened in sumgait it will go down in history i'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops they even fought the soldiers many soldiers were wounded the mob threw fuel mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers setting them on fire they weren't afraid they were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our troops i saw the clashes on february NUM near the airline ticket office right across from our building and that mob was fighting with the soldiers the inhabitants of some of the buildings also azerbaijanis threw rocks at the soldiers from windows balconies even cinder blocks and glass tanks they weren't afraid of them i say they were sure of their impunity when we were at the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket office i called the police at number NUM and said that they were robbing armenian apartments and burning homes and they told me that they knew that they were being burned during those days no one from the police department came to anyone's aid no one came to help us either to our home even though perhaps they could have come and saved us as we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs near the bus station rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in fighting so i think all of it was arranged in advance they even knew in which buildings and apartments the armenians lived on which floorsthey had lists the bandits you can tell that the operation was planned in advance thanks of course to our troops to the country's leadership and to the leadership of the ministry of defense for helping us thanks to the russian people because the majority of the troops were russians and the troops suffered losses too i want to express this gratitude in the name of my family and in the name of all armenians and in the name of all sumgait armenians for coming in time and averting terrible things worse would have happened if that mob had not been stopped on time at present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the ussr procuracy i want to say that those bandits should receive the severest possible punishment because if they don't the tragedy the genocide could happen again everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted out for such deeds very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest in the mass disturbances the mobs were huge at present not all of them have been caught very few of them have been i think judging by the newspaper reports there were around NUM people near our building alone that's how many people took part in the pogrom of our building all in

jeremy g mereness zonkercmuedu says can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc i am fixing to buy a car in the next few months aiming toward something a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power i am considering the mx6 probe accord corolla and the 240sx i bought a '93 probe gt with the pep 263a last july now at NUM miles after debating over the sentra sernx2000 mx6 mr2 stealth prelude and celica the car design is different than earlier years so it's too early to see its reliability so far for what it's worth my comments my dislikes shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal some other owners on the fordprobeworldstdcom mailing list have commented about this problem but i haven't seen it happen on my NUM month old '93 probe gt i think this may be something that ford has corrected since the initial batch of cars also someone said that ford has issued a service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem so you may be able to get your dealer to fix it headlights have stuck up a few times weather air conditioning broke NUM miles pressure cycling switch condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely haven't seen any of these problems nor have i seen these mentioned on the mailing list so these might just be having bad luck with these crammed engine little hope for doityourselfers typical definitely parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not stitched properly hopefully just a fluke no problems like these either i haven't been able to find any obvious places where they screwed up ford only gives NUM key with the car c'mon ford spend an extra few pennies hmmm i got two keys with my car something tells me you got stiffed by your dealer on this actually if you count the credit card key that came in the owner's binder i got NUM keys but since the credit card key doesn't have any teeth cut in it yet i guess i won't count it rear hatch has no padding on corners when up i'm waiting for the day when i bash my head on the corner horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference the latter is probably because of the air bag it's pretty much takes up all the space where you'd expect to find the horn speaking of the horn i was surprised to find that the probe comes with one of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the japanese sounding kind the previous probes had japanese horns tires fling dirtmud onto side of car yeah not very badly but enough to be annoying sometimes my likes engine designvalvessoundssmoothnesspowermileagetorque definitely NUM handling very good for fwd understeer only at limits transmission the NUM speed is a must usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere very little torque steer at full power much better than the '90 sho i drive stability at 100mph high gearing though low cowl good visibility in front heated outside mirrors nice in fog never tested in freezing weather absair bag see above rear seats fold down i have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important no shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still tires 22555vr16 goodyear eagles NUM left hoping for 30k i agree strongly with all of the above especially about the engine the interior is very very nice too very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically sound i drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the probe's suspension doesn't like potholes when you test drive one find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable yes this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car i'd strongly suggest looking into the mx6 if you have NUM passengers by all means bring them along too they'll find that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides differently if that's better is up to you the problem with the back seat is that there's no leg room plenty of head room though shorter people fit back there without any complaints so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to give them a place to put their feet also there's a lot of glass around you which i wasn't expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer my back seat passengers now very few complain about the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with the heat the power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car i really enjoy the moonroof by the way but then i've always been a sucker for open air driving no leakage problems or anything like thatyet i've heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine i haven't heard about this one i know that some of the very early probes '89 and maybe '90 had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which ford will replace at no charge but i haven't heard about anything like this concerning the '93 probes i haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a cv joint boot that was leaking but the dealer took care of that promptly and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that i was without my car i was quite happy with the way they handledespecially considering that i was expecting the worst from them from what i've heard it sounds like fordmazda had some qc problems with the probe and probably mx6 when they first went into production but i think these problems have mostly been corrected at this

little more power i am considering the mx6 probe accord corolla and the 240sx the probe is the youngest of the bunch thus my interest in opinions but every magazine and ratings book places it as an excellent value btw the 240sx is rearwheel drive and is due for a redesign for NUM thanks in advance while i don't read normally read this group i was looking for valentine radar information sigh maybe in the faq and came across your posting i bought a '93 probe gt with the pep 263a last july now at NUM miles after debating over the sentra sernx2000 mx6 mr2 stealth prelude and celica check this month's consumer reports for previous probe records my criteria a fun car with abs airbag over 130hp and less than 25k i thought about a turbo but checking with insurance people ruled that out the tristar cars eclipsetalonetc were out since they don't have an air bag ditto for the mustangalso no abs the sernx2000m20 fell into the pocketrocket category a good used car buy the mx6 was almost there but rolled more than i liked i didn't like the prelude dashinstrumentation at all too weird for me the mr2 has a much smaller nonpassenger space than i needed so out that went the celica was ok but underpowered when loaded with options and somewhat overpriced too in nonturbo form i never considered the 240sx since it didn't have an airbag i did look at it for its rwd virtues but that's it the corolla never entered my mind i should have looked at the mitsubishi vr4dodge stealth more since my list was exhausted i bought the probe the car design is different than earlier years so it's too early to see its reliability so far for what it's worth my comments my dislikes shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal headlights have stuck up a few times weather air

interested in the engine while it doesn't have the uummmph of a bigliter car or the turbo rush the big selling point for me was the allaluminum NUM value NUM liter engine the overall car is a good buy for the money that market segment hasn't changed much since july prelude vtec honda del sol i drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the probe's suspension doesn't like potholes when you test drive one find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable if you have NUM passengers by all means bring them along too they'll find that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides differently if that's better is up to you also there's a lot of glass around you which i wasn't expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer my back seat passengers now very few complain about the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with the heat i've heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when i got the car so i can't comment on them i got the car before it was officially announced i prefer cloth to leather anyway i wouldn't want this car in the snow the suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes tires aren't meant for snow and the seats assume that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing rain is much better water generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable and i barely hydroplaned once with the eagles and i was really trying there is also a definite lack of cup holdersmall storage places the gt has map holders below the speakers in the door but they're rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or cd's max the center consolestorage binarm rest has NUM cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth pouch but that's it no change holders quite a

geared to the automotive enthusiast and so is not crossposted to miscconsumers rpw changes as of NUM april NUM revised brake fluid section as nonsilicone dot5 fluids are now apparently available rpw commonly asked automotive questions tire questions q what do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean a typically you will see something like 19560hr14 the NUM is the overall width of the tire in millimeters the tread is usually narrower the NUM is the aspect ratio' it indicates the height of the sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width our example tire has a sidewall height of NUM NUM NUM mm the NUM is the wheel diameter in inches there are also some special tires called trx' tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations like NUM which is in millimeters the r means radial and the h is a speed rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire when properly inflated and carrying an appropriate load may safely operate common speed ratings are s 112mph t 118mph h 130mph and v up to 150mph recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed rating to a different part of the designation you may therefore find designations like 19560r14 85h the NUM indicates the pertire load associated with the speed rating exceeding this load in continuous operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice what follows is a table showing a number of load indices' and corresponding maximum pertire loads load index NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM max load kg NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM note that the usual mass vs weight confusion occurs in this table in some cases the letters p or lt may be found in front of a tire size the lt designation indicates light truck and the p designation indicates passenger car if no letter is given then the application of the tire is passenger car usage as far as i know these letters only appear in the us market the lt designation is prinicipally of interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles for the owner of a passenger vehicle there is no meaningful difference between a tire with a p designation and one with no designation at all if the aspect ratio is omitted it is probably NUM but may be NUM tires with an ms mudsnow designation may have their speed rating reduced by NUM kmh about 12mph there is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature traction and treadwear temperature and traction are graded a b and c with a the best and c the worst treadwear is a numeric rating these values are of limited value as they are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires q my car has tires with a funny size designation 18565hr390 can i put normal tires on the car a your tires are called trx tires they were devised by michelin because of a somewhat different bead design they are incompatible with normal tires michelin used a different diameter wheel for them so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel and so that more conventional tires could not be mounted on trx type wheels you will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your car it is barely possible to fit normal tires on trx wheels and horribly dangerous to do so the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner or possibly blow out at high speed trx type tires are becoming hard to find in addition to michelin avon makes suitable tires goodyear has apparently discontinued their line of trx tires q can i rotate radials from side to side or rotate them only on one side of my car a car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject many say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a car is now ok this group includes michelin and goodyear others for example pirelli and nokia will void warranties if such swapping is done the best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before rotating your tires and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations q how many snow tires should i buy and if i buy NUM which end of the car should i put them on a in short NUM and both ends to explain many drivers in areas that don't get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively or at all in snow conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels but there are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice with a rear wheel drive car you can choose between being able to start the car going a function of the rear axle or stopping and turning the car a function of the front axle in a front wheel drive car you start stop and turn with the front end the primary risk of putting the snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes while going downhill you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards radar detectors and speed limits q why aren't there any comments on radar detectors and speed limits in this qa posting a because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between miscconsumers and recautos always start long tedious and pointless flame wars if you want to talk about either of these topics please subscribe to recautos or altflame and keep it there safety equipment q do airbags really work a preliminary statistics suggest the following airbags work much better than no belts good NUM point belts alone work much better than airbags alone and airbags NUM point belts work slightly better than NUM point belts alone the con to airbags is that some designs tend to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the explosion that occurs inside the bag and that some designs but not all may knock the driver's hands from the wheel making retention of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult brake questions q do i always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned midas always wants to do this a no there are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing rotors some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors more often than is strictly necessary if the rotors are not warped warped and only lightly grooved then there is no need to replace or to turn them note also that some rotors the rotors on many hondas are a good example are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical to turn them they must be replaced when they become too thin warped or badly grooved q they tell me i should downshift when braking to slow my car down is this really a good idea a it used to be a very good idea back in the days of mediocre fade prone drum brakes in modern disc brake equipped cars use of downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary except in cases of long steep downhill runs otherwise modern disc brakes are more than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances and they are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings on the other hand many standard driver's license tests in the usa still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking i suggest that before taking a us driver's test you either NUM learn to do this smoothly which takes some time and practice or NUM borrow a car with an automatic to take the test q how often should i replace my brake fluid a probably more often than you do traditional brake fluids tend to absorb water this water can corrode internal parts of the brake system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid dot3 type are older fluids dot4 and dot5 are newer specifications the principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points the dry boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid but the wet boiling point is important in older brake fluid dot3 fluids have the lowest wet and dry boiling point requirements dot4 fluids have better boiling point requirements and dot5 fluids have the best boiling point requirements but dot5 fluids are not clearly superior see the next qa for more details while the requirements imply that dot4 fluids are better than dot3 fluids there may be specific cases where a dot3 fluid is preferable but these are mostly competition applications otherwise dot4 type fluids offer much improved brake pedal feel replacement once a year is recommended for dot4 fluids although agressive drivers may profit by changing out fluid more frequently or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid out of the brake calipers fairly regularly q what about dot5 brake fluids a this breaks down in to two parts the dot5 specification looks excellent for performance but the first dot5 fluids were silicone based silicone fluids are a tricky proposition unlike dot3 and dot4 fluids they do not absorb water at all while this may sound like a feature the problem is that any water present pools up in such systems interfering with braking performance and corroding any metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring the water will tend to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers where most of the corrosion occurs because of this phenomenon it is essential when converting to silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly beforehand some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the brake system when converting to silicone fluids two other issues that come up with silicone fluids NUM they are difficult to pour cleanly that is without air bubbles which interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel and NUM while they generally have much higher boiling points than dot4 fluids they do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable in effect from boiling dot4 fluids silicone fluids may make sense in some street car applications but they are certainly not recommended for high performance driving applications and the economics are questionable for street use i have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the dot5 standard that do not contain silicones these fluids appear to be reasonably compatible with the older dot3 and dot4 fluids but i have little information at this time q abs is available on some of the cars i'm looking at but it costs more is it worth it a this does not have a cut and dried answer therefore this answer will be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons the short answer is that abs costs more both initially and to maintain will generally work better for the average driver' that is to say a driver who does not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques and may require the unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case now for the long answer abs works by monitering the wheels of the car looking for signs of locked brakes it may or may not be able be able to distinguish between the different wheels there are several systems on the market it cannot detect impending lockup which is what you would really want in an ideal world but only the existence of lockup the sensors used vary some of the less well designed sensors are sensitive to tire size and to brake pad material and may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original equipment or oeequivalent components when the sensors detect lockup the abs system responds by unlocking the brakes either individually or all at once depending on the system if the driver keeps their foot firmly planted the abs will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states if a sensor existed that could detect impending lockup then we could sit right at that point which is where maximum braking effect is achieved this pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal as the system cycles the percentage of the time that the brakes are truly engaged is called the duty cycle' typically in an abs system this is about NUM on dry pavement a trained driver can beat this duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking on wet pavement braking is so chancy that abs will outperform threshold braking nearly every time unfortunately on mud and on snow often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes locked only audi of the manufacturers producing absequipped cars has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the abs system for this eventuality a particularly important feature of abs is that it preserves steering control this is the case simply because if you are braking near the limit and turn the wheel the abs will release the brakes if it sees steeringtriggered lockup and back off on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied braking distances will lengthen accordingly an important caution abs cannot exceed the maximum theoretical braking force in any given situation if you start sliding on glare ice don't expect an abs system to help you out very much the coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an abs system in your car as far as maintenence goes in addition to the potential restrictions i've listed above you have to worry about the following NUM parts costs are much higher the oe master cylinder for my obscure european sedan lists for NUM but the oe master cylinder for the absequipped version of the same car lists for over NUM most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of dot5 silicone brake fluids in absequipped vehicles because of the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system components regular i suggest annual replacement of brake fluid becomes very important q what about this threshold braking business a normally i'd not put this in the consumers qa but recent publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers in absequipped chevy caprices suggests that this section is needed here rpw threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high performance drivers if made a habit it replaces the stab the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely and is much to be prefered basically the premise is that tires generate maximum braking force when they have just started to slide but just before the wheels lock up entirely drivers who threshold brake learn to feel what this threshold' feels like and learn to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake pedal in many cars you can feel that you are near the threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it in any case if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit you're not very near the threshold in a car with abs often there is a twinge in the pedal just before the system starts cycling if the driver backs off on the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt then they are very close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the abs take over recently there has been a rash of publicity over a number of accidents and one death involving police cars equipped with abs systems the police departments in question quickly blamed the new abs systems but according to autoweek magazine it now seems clear that the problem was a lack of training none of the involved officers had any recent performance driving training there is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing brake pedal by pump braking' an old and discredited technique of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal the goal being to try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system if you think about it for a minute you'll realize that pump braking must cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least NUM so if you cut the NUM duty cycle of an abs system by that much you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective and useful technique regardless of whether your car has abs if you do fear a failed hydraulic system then one or two stabs at the pedal will be sufficient gas questions q does high octane gasoline help a maybe maybe not some cars have knock sensors and can adjust the engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used on most cars however you should use the cheapest gas that makes your car run well check your owner's manual for details on what your car needs q my car was made for leaded gasoline will unleaded gas hurt it a it is possible that unleaded gas may slightly increase valve wear although the amoco oil company argues otherwise the actual increase in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable however as modern leaded gasolines actually contain very little lead you should however check your owner's manual many cars from the early 1970s do not actually require leaded gasoline q do fuel treatments help what kind should i use a some do and some don't during the winter it is a good idea to use dry gas however some may be harmful to fuel injection systems never use an additive containing methanol sometimes called methyl alcohol such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing ethanol sometimes called ethyl alcohol if your car has fuel injection check the owner's manual on your car before using these most manufacturers consider NUM ethanol acceptable in gasoline additives with isopropyl alcohol isopropanol and petroleum distillates are fine in fuel injected cars an occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with fuel injectors although many premium gasolines contain detergents that do the same job some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain ethanol or methanol always check the ingredients before putting anything in your gas tank there are a small number of particularly good additives these are noticeably more expensive that the runofthemill ones but work much much better among these are chevron techron redline sl1 wurth lubrimoly ventil sauber' and bg 44k a bottle of one of these once every six months is highly recommended q what about detergent gasolines a the quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat bmw has instituted a testing program and gasoline brands which pass this test may advertise that fact stickers indicating passage of the test are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations if such gasolines are used then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional beforewarned that while use of bmw approved gasolines will keep a clean engine clean they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits lubrication questions q what do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean a there are several different items encoded there is a twoletter code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer uses in the oil this looks like sesfcd or such the s codes are for gasoline engine applications the c codes are for diesel engine applications the second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels of protection are developed thus sf is considered better than se se is considered better than sd and so forth the more noticeable designation is the oil weight this is either a single number eg NUM weight or a pair of numbers separated by the letter w eg 10w30 the latter type is much more commonly used these days and are the only type that most automobile manufacturers specify in operators manuals the first number in the designation 10w is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold the w stands for winter' the second number NUM is the viscosity of the oil when hot there is a trick here the oil doesn't actually get thicker turn from NUM weight to NUM weight as it gets hotter what is actually happening is that when the oil is cold it has the viscosity of a cold NUM weight oil as it gets hotter it doesn't get thin as fast as a 10w oil would by the time it is up to temperature it has the viscosity of a hot NUM weight oil note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities not all 10w oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold and not all NUM weight oils have the same viscosity when hot note also that the novel behaviour of multigrade oils is caused by additives and it has been reported that with the sole exception of castrol gtx 10w40 oils do not retain their multigrade characteristics well over time 10w30 15w40 and 20w50 oils work very well though q are quick lube' places any good a some do adequate work but there are quite a few incompetent ones out there let the buyer beware watch them while they work make sure that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug and keep your hand on your wallet at all times q are oil additives like slick50 or tufoil any good a slick50 and tufoil are ptfebased additives many of these have come onto the market recently they are different from the molybased additives that have been around since the early 50's ptfe is the chemical name for teflontm a trademark owned by dupont in general auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products most usenet responses to questions on these additives are favorable slight increase of mpg after application smoother revving but long term results whether ptfe additives are effective after 5k miles are debatable some manufacturers such as saab claim that either the product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage some bmw owners have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of slick NUM to their cars this writer has been cautioned by a slick50 dealer that slick50 should not be used in japanese motors as it may clog the oil return passages in the engine otherwise there are no known reports of damage caused by ptfe additives on the other hand there are satified slick NUM customers in the world q do synthetic oils really work a yes but more specifically most auto manufactuers accept synthetics but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by oil manufacturers auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your car even if you decide to try the longer intervals at least change the oil filter at regular intervals as synthetics get just as dirty as conventional oils synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter entirely amsoil redline and agip are very highly regarded and very effective mobil NUM synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews however q manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals how often should i change my oil a it depends on how you drive if your car always or nearly always gets warmed up and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs down the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine if however you drive it hard drive it at high revs or alternatively if you only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up to temperature then you may wish to change oil much more often perhaps at NUM mile intervals given that most manufacturers are now specifying NUM mile intervals if you don't drive your car much at all say NUM miles a year then you probably want to change oil every six months anyway if you are storing a car during the winter then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out of storage misc questions q my car has a timing belt i hear that bad things happen when they break what's the story a it depends on the internal design of the motor early ford escorts for example will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks but the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt some honda motors will not be damaged but others will be if no replacement interval is specified for your car then change the belt at least every NUM miles some cars may require more frequent replacement ask your dealer or independent mechanic also ask if there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time for example the same ford escorts that suffer valve damage also have a timing belt driven water pump which has been known to seize destroying the timing belt and which then causes major valve damage as a side effect replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water pump can be a costly mistake q why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it self destructs when the timing belt breaks a for performance reasons compromising piston design so that the valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression ratio of the engine be reduced significantly this is why you are more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance oriented vehicles q what causes unintended acceleration a the final report of the national highway transportation and safety administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the same time be consistent with the physical evidence the nhtsa report goes on to conclude that pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator is probably the cause richard welty NUM weltycabotballtowncmacom nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about

recautosvw is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by volkswagen this includes vws audis seats etc it was created on the grounds that the infovw mailing list was very successful it should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest via some avenue such as a mailing list recaudiocar is not properly part of the recautos hierarchy it is however the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment and so is mentioned here recautosantique is intended for the discussion of older cars usually more than NUM years old although this is not a hardandfast rule althotrod is not part of the hierarchy but also of potential interest to the recautos reader it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles altautosrodncustom also not part of the official' hierarchy devoted to that peculiar american hobby of customizing older cars altautoskarting for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby karting recautos is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics crossposting crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on the newsgroups line in the article header such articles will appear in all of the newsgroups listed crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on usenet you should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate you should never crosspost just to reach a particular audience this distinction is subtle but important radar detector articles for example are moreorless appropriate in recautos they are almost never appropriate in scielectronics or rechamradio and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in scielectronics or rechamradio is not adequate justification for posting to either group crossposting between any or all of the recautos groups is usually inappropriate if you find yourself doing so consider whether or not it is truly advisable before sending your article consider setting followupto to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost crossposting between recautos and miscconsumers is chancy at best in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the us andor the use of radar detectors should never be crossposted between any of these groups most readers of scielectronics and recradio couldn't care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in recautos it is an excellent idea to check the newsgroups and followupto lines of articles before posting a followup in particular be wary of posting to misctest recartsstartrek or talkbizarre or any combination of these three the life you save may be your own distribution there is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to partially control where the article goes it is called the distribution field it may be very useful for many reasons it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system the distribution of recautos is fairly extensive as of this writing the automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of europe australia new zealand and some locations in japan with this in mind i offer the following hints about use of the distribution field in your article headers and on article content NUM please take care not to send forsale ads about clapped out ford mavericks in new jersey to france or california i doubt that anyone in either place will care except for my girlfriend who for some strange reason likes mavericks but only 4door mavericks at that NUM when posting technical questions please include the market for which your car was manufactured for example there are a number of differences between a europeanmarket ford escort and a usmarket escort likewise all 1750cc and early 2000cc alfa romeos reached the us with spica fuel injection european market cars usually got carbs often webers these differences can be important to your readers make your situation clear failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation NUM be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting in the us we get a mix of metric and english system values whereas europe is almost entirely on the metric system a future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonlyused abbreviations that may not be known in some places that recautos reaches this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it NUM use the distribution field to limit where your article goes when possible within north america the values na north america can canada and usa may be used in addition the twoletter state abbreviations of the us are supported in some cases eg if i wanted to send an article only to new york and new jersey i could put nynj in a distribution field note that multiple commaseparated values are legal these distribution fields vary widely however so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area the dangers of overgeneralization to amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars tires etc what is true for a NUM buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a NUM honda with a 1200cc engine headlight laws in sweden are decidedly different from those in idaho the need for adequate specification when you ask a question please give a reasonable amount of information eg if you have a question about your honda please specify year model engine size etc otherwise most answers to your question may be quite useless concerning lemons at one time or another every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two even honda admits to this please don't waste everyone's time by announcing to the world that your brand x' automobile is terrible so all brand x' automobiles are terrible so no one should ever buy a car from the brand x' company such articles are worse than useless because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information concerning flames as much as we might wish it a flamefree newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them a list of flameprone topics follows in the next section of this posting if you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory don't imagine for a minute that including the words no flames' will work it won't and you'll get exactly what you deserve if you're going to flame you're more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a wellknown reference no one is likely to believe bald unsupported assertions be careful about who you choose to insult consider not insulting anyone asking the question it is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like please send email i don't read this group' it is a much better idea to end the question with please send email if there is sufficient interest i'll summarize the results in a later posting i may miss posted responses to this request' answering the question if someone wants to hop up their yugo don't tell them to get a mustang either be silent or give them useful advice if someone wants advice on defending a speeding ticket don't tell them to obey the law next time it's offensive presumes guilt which is not proven and doesn't directly address the original question in general don't post in order to see your words in print and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and selfrighteous stale andor inflammatory topics certain topics are considered stale by old timers' while discussion of them is certainly ok and new factual information is welcome ravings about them are extremely tiresome and may get the person who posts them ignored altogether some topics are naturally inflammatory it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them some of these topics include the following NUM the 55mph speed limit in the us pro and con NUM discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of radar detectors NUM discussions over which radar detector is best NUM discussions over what is a sports car this is one reason why recautossport is not a sports car' group everyone would argue about what constitutes a sports car' NUM disputes

where are radar detectors illegal a in the us currently virgina and the district of columbia prohibit all usage of radar detectors new york prohibits their use in large trucks in canada they are illegal in manitoba ontario quebec newfoundland and pei prince edward island they are apparently are illegal through most if not all of europe legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other jurisdictions chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal q where are radar detector detectors used do they really work a usage is spreading rapidly initially they were used only in canada but now they are appearing in new york and virginia it is unsafe to assume that they are not in use in connecticut and dc they work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently available super het radar detectors some brands of detector radiate more strongly than others and are thus more likely to be spotted new radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected by the current generation of detector detectors note that a detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned on q what is vascar is it some kind of radar a vascar is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and timespeeddistance computer it depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target vehicle passes landmarks no radar signals are emitted by a vascar system q what is ka band radar where is it used should a radar detector be able to handle it a ka band has recently been made available by the fcc for use in the us in socalled photoradar installations in these installations a lowpowered beam is aimed across the road at a NUM degree angle to the direction of traffic and a picture is taken of vehicles which the radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle because of the low power and the NUM degree angle many people believe that a radar detector cannot give reasonable warning of a ka band radar unit although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such capability anyway the number of locales where photoradar is in use is limited and some question the legality of such units best advice learn what photo radar units look like and keep track of where they are used or else don't speed q do radar jammers work are they legal a quick answer no and not in the usa detailed answer cheap radar jammers do not work well at all jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the military jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the federal communications commission of the usa driving technique and vehicle dynamics questions q what are understeer and oversteer a understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a car while cornering near the limit' limit of adhesion that is most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to be descriptive of the situations they encounter simply put they tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner steer less' or understeer' or it wants to turn more in a corner oversteer' understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that untrained drivers inadvertantly traveling too fast won't get into trouble understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle in a corner oversteer is designed into some more performance oriented cars it may be induced by lifting on the throttle trailing throttle oversteer or tto in extreme cases lifting on the throttle may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or spinning some technical details in a corner at speed the tires on the car will develop what are called slip angles' the slip angle is the angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to travel in understeer the front wheels have a greater slip angle than the rear wheels in oversteer the rear wheels have a greater slip angle than the front wheels q what is a revmatched downshift a when downshifting the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear than it was in the higher gear however during a downshift normally you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle so the revs drop rather than increase in revmatched downshift you blip the throttle before reengaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to the new speed this results in a much smoother and faster downshift q what does heelandtoe mean a heelandtoe is a technique used to do a revmatched downshift while braking this is normally challenging because you need the right foot for both the brake and throttle it is called heelandtoe because you use one end of the foot on the brake and the other on the throttle to match revs for the downshift in many modern cars this is a misnomer often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side on the throttle note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch and just use the left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle accomplishing the same thing q what is doubleclutch downshifting a while your right foot is doing the above your left foot can do one of three things nothing declutch once or declutch twice the reason for declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the transmission to the speed of the engine this is usually coupled with revmatching so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch engaged the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission speed up the procedure is as follows NUM declutch NUM move gearshift lever to neutral NUM engage clutch NUM match revs NUM declutch NUM move gearshift lever to next lower gear NUM engage clutch this sounds like a lot of work but with practice it becomes natural the problem that doubleclutching solves is normally the function of the synchronizers within the gearbox in transmissions without synchros or with very worn synchros doubleclutching makes it much easier to shift basically if you doubleclutch well you are not using the synchros at all this is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good condition q what do the numbers for acceleration from NUM NUM mile skidpad and slalom times in the auto magazines really mean may they be compared a in short NUM not as much as the magazines want you to believe and NUM almost never in more detail the acceleration numbers 060mph and NUM mile times in the us may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the same source testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine that comparing a road track number to a car driver number is quite pointless keep in mind too that the same variation applies from driver to driver on the street the driver is a major often the major part of the equation skidpads vary and even if they didn't skidpad figures are really only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires they change radically when tire compounds change do not make any assumptions about the comparative handling of say two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers this is not to suggest that skidpads are without value however skidpads are an excellent educational tool at driving schools they are simply of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires slalom times are slightly more useful they test some small parts of the automobile's transient response however they are also heavily influenced by the stock rubber on the car and they do not test many corners of the car's envelope they do not tell you all you need to know before making a buying decision for example they don't tell you what the rear end of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes offcamber when a car has an adjustable suspension these tests are usually done in the sport' setting which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving the list of caveats could go on for page after page q my buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference according to his freshman physics textbook and that you can't ever accelerate or corner at more than 10g does he know what he's talking about a NUM in short he hasn't got a clue NUM in more detail the equations for friction used in freshman physics textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth dry and nondeformable none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating temperature pavement is never smooth it is always irregular to a greater or lesser extent tires which are not really dry and solid as rubber is a substance which in its natural form is liquid and which has only been coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic deform to match the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over in a tire at operating temperature grip is actually generated by shear stresses inside the deformed rubber and not by anything even remotely resembling friction in the freshman physics sense of the term the colder a tire is relative to its operating temperature the closer its behaviour will be to the traditional concept of friction if much hotter than the its proper operating temperature the more likely the possibility of some part of the tire actually reverting'' to liquid which is mostly like to happen deep in the tread causing characteristic blisters and chunking this latter though is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal street driving so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of high speed track driving don't worry about it because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all thus dragsters accelerate at more than 10g and race cars corner and brake at more than 10g because simple friction does not apply it is actually possible for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of grip an actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques such as finite element analysis due to the complexity of the mechanism misc questions q what does name or acronym stand for a here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked about be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names as misinformation abounds on the net in particular never ask in rechumor if you want a useful result saab svenska aeroplan a b or the swedish airplane

started acting up again i just stopped putting money into it i must have put at least NUM worth of repairs over it's lifetime i am sorry but lee iacocca can bite me bullshit whoever backs em best is just afraid the stupid things are going to fall apart and no one will buy them without assurance why the hell do you think that lh has been nicknamed last hope you can do better and i know people will disagree with me here but japanese like honda or toyota or the only american car company that i feel is a quality product saturn i will not touch another chrysler product again no way i don't care how good the lh cars look good and i will admit they look promising but not with the support that you get gm isn't much better thank god they don't control saturn like they do their divisions or it would be just another marketing ploy don't get me wrong i will be watching my car which i do like like a hawk for the next NUM years i am much more hesitant to say it or any car is really good until it has proved itself to me but since someone else pointed out cd as a source i will note because i used to read these magazines that car and driver has never had a good thing to say about most chrysler products shadow for one always were they moaning about the reguritated kcar and engine whereas motor trend always thought they were great cars no car magazine is really objective and although there are alot of people who don't like consumers reports i will use them to reinforce my argument i already know about the big stink with the saturn crash tests time will tell how good a car they are the shadowsundance rate much worse than average in fact none of the chrysler's rate a better than average i think the best one is just average excluding the diamond starmitsubishi stuff and the lh's you can find bad stuff about the shadow try as i might when i researched the saturn i could not find anything bad about it there is a great deal of information about this company just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community for good reason much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company i read an article which had a subcolumn an i think this imprinted on me more than anything else some big wig in toyota said and i quote we are watching them very closely come on everybody grow up the foreign cars especially the japanese have been kicking our butts for good reason the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days to set in their ways which is one of the reasons saturn was created they are still struggling because they haven't learned yet they have the ability the workers are not inferior the technology is not out of date but their attitude is

beyond the under NUM age group but i have an experience a few years ago that might be interesting to you i owned a NUM toyota celica gt i decided to buy myself a gift a more exotic car front runners included the toyota supra turbo and the porsche NUM NUM model years i narrowed it down to those two i liked the simplicity and handling and snob appeal too of driving a porsche the supra turbo was less money and had more features and performance almost a personal luxury car it had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the NUM i was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the NUM but i decided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way i asked about what would happen to my rate with either car if you buy the supra your rate classification will be the same as the celica the '85 celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars with a slight increase because the car will be NUM years newer our lowerrisk division will continue to handle your account if you buy the porsche NUM we'll have to change you to the standard higher rate company and your rate will double and if you go with a NUM it's another story again we'll cover the rest of this year but cancel you after that but the supra is much faster than the NUM and the NUM is actually faster than the standard NUM that doens't make sense that's what the book says we don't insure corvettes either for some reason the underwriters consider supras and their drivers as very traditional and conservative i eventually went with the supra for a number of reasons the porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough highpressure guy in the back room at equal monthly payments it would have taken a year longer to pay for the porsche plus its

writes my question is given so many separations in the armenian community what was the common denominator of the armenian people that allowed armenian nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century as i stated religion there are various contradictory views on the origin of the armenians the name is to be found in the darian inscriptions in the form 'armina' or 'aramaniya' is to be found in the inscription on the bistun monument the following references to the armenians are to be found in the bistun cuneiform inscription of dara vishdasb NUM bc NUM the monarch dara said i sent my servant to arminam 'armeniya' NUM on reaching arminam 'armeniya' NUM to the country town of zozo to armaniya 'armeniya' according to karakashian as for 'armenia' the equivalent of the 'armin' or 'arminik' of the persians this is more recent than the word 'ararat' and is to be found used in the dara inscriptions for 'haiastan' saint martin the name 'armenie' has been given since very early times by almost all the various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the armenians as 'haiastan' it was known to the syrians as armenia and to the arabs as ermeniyye others believe that urartu was known in the time of the medes as 'harminap' which was later modified by the persians to 'arminia' 'ar' refers to a place as in ararat archish aruyr archar arshav arazen and aror while 'men' is used to refer to spirit thought or human being and therefore 'armen' would appear to signify 'the people of that place' g alishan believes that 'according to our national vocabulary haik is the diminutive form of hai and that hai is the name of our nation our nation is in no way connected with the word armen that foreigners apply to our people' it would thus appear that 'armenia' is a placename that 'armen' is the name of the people who lived there and that these are in no way connected with the word 'hai' haik and haiastan armenian historians believe haik to have been a great hero from whom the armenian people took the name 'hai' but the mere resemblance between the words 'haik' and 'hai' constitutes no real proof and in any case no such theory appears before the time of moses of khoren haiasa the following studies show quite clearly that 'hai' and 'haiasa' were no more than general names used by the hittites to refer to the region known as armenia professor hachadurian 'haiasa was the general name used in hittite inscriptions for upper armenia' yensen in his 'hittites and armenians' tries to prove that 'hai' is identical with the hittite 'hatio' in other words that 'hai' is a hittite word research however has proved this erroneous and shown that 'hai' was derived from 'hatio' mortman's attempt to read the urartu inscriptions as armenian met with no success as for greek there is no point in even mentioning it the resemblance between the words 'haiasa' and 'haiastan' is so obvious that we may well accept 'haiasa' as the oldest form of 'haiastan' let us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'hai' 'haikazan' and 'haiastan' entered our older works according to karakashian 'the word haik is never to be found employed with reference to a leader of the armenian people prior to moses of khoren nor is it ever found employed in the forms haika or haykazn agahangelos and puzant use the word as a title or a placename he improved and developed haiastan etc if the word had referred to a nation and had been derived from hai or haik they could also have used the words haikak and haykazn in a number of places' according to professor sayce who deciphered a number of hittite inscriptions 'in the hittite language the suffix ha is used to specify quality or species the words haddanas haddina were used by the assyrians to refer to the hittites with the transformation of the d between the two a letters to y hadinasdani was in this way transformed to haiastan' professor grechmer fully agrees with this point of view but regards the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'hai' and 'haistan' as quite unsatisfactory he finds however that a solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'haiasa' which is so frequently found in bogazkoy from NUM bc onwards forrer takes 'haiasa' as referring to upper armenia in that case it seems likely that 'haiasa' was actually a part of armenia the suffix dan is of anatolian origin the real root is 'hayasa' which refers to the country of the 'hayasas' e chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological and anthropological characteristics of the armenian people the armenians in russia may be characterized as

owen made appearances in new york city on the donahue and charlie rose shows on a couple of occasions on those shows lord owen gave away his proserbian position when he made the point that much or most of the bosnian territory then in dispute or already overrun by serbian forces had been controlled and occupied by serbs before wwii it was as if he were saying that since the serbs had previously occupied those territories and lost them during the hitler years they should be allowed to reconquer them today i was familiar with this view because my father a yugoslav jew who escaped to this country during the war was aided and found sympathy among the serbs during those harrowing years in recent months when the subject of serbian aggression was mentioned my father would make the point that NUM serbs were killed by nazi and pronazi croatian forces known as the ustasha my father is so proserbian that he dismissed reports of serbian atrocities my father also excoriated new york times columnist anthony lewis because my father said anthony lewis is always talking about the muslims updateapril NUM NUM after an uneasy truce in and around sbernica shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides and the killing and the misery continues apace while the clinton administration dithers its response in the days leading to the collapse of resistance at sbernica lord owen changed his tune previously he had opposed military intervention on the grounds that it would endanger un relief workers when serbian forces began to march on sbernica the threat to un relief soldiers went unmentioned while lord owen called for outside intervention to stop serbian aggression including the use of air strikes the current disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the west and a failure of the vanceowen initiative which did nothing to halt the serbs now that it's too late to save muslim areas that lord owen felt should be in a muslim state lord owen belatedly calls for strong action clinton and bosnia in the summer of NUM george kenney a senior state department official the undersecretary in charge of the yugoslav desk made news when he resigned from the state department because of the bush administration's refusal to take any action to halt serbian aggression as kenney saw it bush's inaction was largely due to the president's unwillingness to risk any political capital by getting involved there apparently the same is true of the clinton administration clinton gives the impression that he cares more than bush did about the terrible ongoing tragedy but the practical effect has so far been the same according to the new york times NUM the clinton administration did everything it could to suppress a midmarch report by its own experts which called for military action if necessary to protect safe havens for the muslims at one point senate majority leader george mitchell was so incensed that the report was kept from congress that he called for an investigation instead of helping the desperate bosnians clinton has signalled again and again that milosevic and the serbs are free to do what they want in bosniaindeed clinton and the west have been signalling that the serbs should get on with the job and finish off the bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the other way a key signal was when clinton made it clear that he would not send in american military forces on the ground on this issue clinton has made me wistful for bush bush and baker could not have done worse and might have been pressured to do better well before this time lives in bosnia might have been saved and the destruction might have been curtailed the nation the left and the bosnian quandary typical of the left's inability to come to grips with the core issue involved in bosnia ie a clear aggressor destroying hundreds of thousands of lives is the editorial on the bosnian quandary in the nation NUM in the end the editorial votes to do nothing even while noticing the ghastly atrocities of the bosnian serbs and that the greater and lesser powersdither and fuss and hang back before anything else happens the clinton administration ought to pay the NUM million the united states owes the un the editorial concludes in its most striking passage the editorial writer warns that those who are pushing president clinton to intervene on the side of the bosnians had better review us foreign policy since world war ii the editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the bosnian serbs are no worse than any number of us clients including the chileans the south africans the greek fascists and others in a subsequent column for the nation christopher hitchens correctly called this editorial contemptible william pfaff a european based journalist who writes for the the new yorker and the los angeles times is among a group of liberal columnists like anthony lewis and leslie gelb who have clearly and consistently called for strong western and american intervention to stop the serbs pfaff's most recent column liberal opinion week NUM is entitled international cowardice worsened bosnian tragedy he clarifies the international failure which has led to present situation in one sentence having refused to intervene to sanction the threat to minority rights in newly independent croatia in june NUM or to block or penalize the military aggression by serbia that immediately followed and the atrocious ethnic cleansing which followed that the united nations now contemplates deploying in bosnia military force on a scale which two years ago could have deterred the horrors yugoslavia has since experienced he goes on to explain that un plans now envisaged call for a more daunting and openended military assignment than a direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have been a year ago aryeh neier on the serbs in his watching rights column in the the nation NUM aryeh neier gets to the heart of the motivation of the aggressorsthe preferred term for the serbian forces who have been besieging and shelling sarajevo for more than a year he explains that there is no military purpose that is served by the destruction of its fabric and its peopleabove all few of those aligned with the forces attacking sarajevo would want to live there even if the city could be rebuilt they are not city people it is this i believeaside from a desire to break the morale of bosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at any pricethat explains the conduct of the siege of sarajevoit is a loathing for all that is urban pluralist and cosmopolitan that has made sarajevo the object for devastation historically most of the serbian population in bosnia and herzegovina has been rural while muslims who were the civil servants and intelligentsia during the centuries of ottoman rule made up a disproportionate share of the urban populationthe destruction of sarajevo is not only an expression of hostility against this city it is also an attack on the urban ideathe demagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this war exploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred for all that is cosmopolitan the light that neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what is at stake the serbs represent the knownothing antisecularist fundamentalist fascist forces who are attacking the urban cosmopolitan secular multicultural idea they are attacking the rest of us just as hitler did one irony is that at the beginning of the crisis over bosnia it was for awhile maintained by the serbs and their supporters that they were responding to a threat by the bosnian muslims to create a fundamentalist state neier has shown that it is the serbs who are the great threat to secularism multiculturalism diversity and democracy it's the serbs who are attacking the democratic notion the democratic idea anthony lewis comes close to the point when he asks why does respect for clinton's presidency dependon his acting effectively against serbian aggressionfirst of all because to do nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the values we and our allies profess times NUM but it's not merely a betrayal of our values it's because the serbs are attacking us by proxy just as hitler was one argument for decisive action by the west that is heard in a different form is that war in the balkans is destablizing for europe we hear it as the bosnians are europe's palestinians that is to say just as the palestinian refugee problem has been the key to instability in the middle east just so will the hundreds of thousands of yugoslav refugees of all ethnicities result in turmoil in europe for decades to come one of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even though the

following that move ar there were massacres of armenians in the azerbaijani cities of sumgait arin february NUM and two years later in baku in january NUM this not true other than simply checking the newspapers i will quote from an independent human rights report in the pax cristi netherlands NUM september NUM page NUM we read by midnovember many incidents took place in several places in

azeris in armenia were chased away in this part of the world february NUM start of organized antiarmenian pogroms in azerbaijan come before november and december of NUM ar azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that ar both events were inspired from moscow to secure russian imperial rule ar in the transcaucasus according to the roman principle of divide and ar rule similar conspiracies are evident throughout the fiveyear ar history of the conflict it is interesting that the azeris killed burnt raped the armenians but the perpetrators blame russians and armenians themselves on other occasions ar each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement in ar zheleznovodsk moscow tehran rome geneva and almaata an ar invisible hand provoked further bloodshed those interested in ar maintaining the azeriarmenian conflict as well as the georgian ar turmoil are imperialist forces in russia and probably in iran incorrect when were the people of nagornokarabakh ever involved in an agreement never until azerbaijan sits down with the armenians of nagorno karabakh there will never be an end to this conflict ar the armenian offensive last spring created more than NUM new azeri ar refugees from the captured towns of upper and lower karabakh and ar adjacent rural districts today NUM azeri refugees throng the ar city of baku and environs providing more problems for the newly ar elected popular front government which is opposed by the rigidly ar nationalistic national independence party it's called war if the azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the armenians of nagornokarabakh to live in their ways keep their armenian culture these armenians would not have had to defend their existence the azeris should not have assumed that armenians were going to roll over and play dead ar how can a westernstyle democracy survive in a small muslim country ar where NUM million of the NUM million inhabitants are unemployed in the ar absence of any international effort to help azeri refugees as kurdish ar and bosnian refugees have been helped how can the azeri government ar reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands homes and ar possessions the azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they attempted to deprive armenians of lands homes and possessions ar such simple realities must be understood in the west ar misunderstanding caucasian politics leads both western and russian ar public opinion to imagine a permanent and therefore irreversible ar ethnic and religious rivalry in the caucasus true and you dr alec rasizade should practice what you preach ar i think western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea ar meanwhile continuation of the war could draw both eastern and western ar states into the conflict through activation of various security ar alliances these include on the armenian side the moscowled ar commonwealth forces under the tashkent mutual security pact signed ar may NUM NUM on the azeri side should turkey get involved as the ar guarantor of the nakhichevan autonomy through the kars treaty of oct ar NUM NUM these include the north atlantic treaty forces western interference turkish intervention the moment turkey dares step into this conflict it will close the doors of any chance of turkey being part of europe as if it ever will and will destroy the eastern third of anatolia dr rasizade international realpolitik is not as simpleminded as you would have us believe ar upper karabakh generally is described in western press reports as an ararmenian enclave within azerbaijan the truth is that the armenians ar began to appear there only in the middle of the last century incorrect once again a brief scan of history addresses such a foolish claim armenians today refer to the area of nagornokarabakh as artsakh which comes from the urartian term urtekheurtekhini no azeris yet ancient greeks referred to artsakh as orkhistena no

no incorrect the NUM celebration was the 150th anniversary of russian rule in the caucasus including karabakh ar at the same time the russian colonial administration also drew ar in russian and german settlers who were welcomed by azeris how ar would americans react if the large numbers of armenians living in ar southern california suddenly claimed an armenian homeland and ar demanded separation from california nonsequitur ar armenian historians insist that before the armenian resettlement ar karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal christians that is correct armenian historians don't say this ar the people of medieval caucasian albania adopted christianity in the ar fourth century but those ancient residents had no link to and ar nothing in common with armenians considering the caucasian albans were of the armenian apostolic faith and their utilization of the armenian language in their liturgy makes such an argument totally invalid ar azeris would have a better claim to ar be successors of albania since azeris have for centuries inhabited ar dominated and developed the karabakh part of the azeri nation wishing to be part of a people nonexistent for nearly a millennium for geo political advantage is rather outrageous in addition to such absurdity azeris claim to be turks persians and all the while are azerizing their minorities such as the lezgians kurds tat talish and a host of other nationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of azerbaijan ar both armenia and azerbaijan last year signed the final act of the ar conference on security and cooperation in europe of NUM and the ar paris charter for new europe of NUM confirming their mutual ar adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders this ar principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the ar republic of azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory ar nations not just by turkey such agreements do not give azerbaijan the right to depopulate karabakh of armenians ar this is one key to intervention on behalf either of the un the ar csce the commonwealth nato or iran the second key to untying the ar caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor according to the ar un definition of NUM fine so why has azerbaijan refused to allow un troops into the armenian enclave what is azerbaijan afraid of perhaps the fact that the territory is the home of armenians the un would by definition support the local population ar when that is accomplished the international community can and should ar apply to the aggressor in the caucasus international sanctions such as ar those presently being employed against serbia and montenegro in the ar former yugoslavia such decisive collective international action can ar halt further aggression in karabakh and prevent the armenianazeri ar conflict from growing and spreading azerbaijan's refusal to allow the armenians of karabakh to determine their own future the is issue not

some revision as i said i do not want to convice anyone so why should my opinions convince anyone i do not believe that my opinions are refuted by facts then you haven't been paying attention to the arguments levelled against them they have been over and over again they will be again so far you have presented your opinions as opposed to mine i would hardly take them as facts maybe youy view of a dictionary is the problem here one thing is the accepted meaning of a word by a dictionary and sometimes a completely different thing is what that word came to mean after a long time hey what do you think dictionaries are for you quite obviously need one a good dictionary gives both and you well know it i could give you hundreds of words in my mother tongue spanish that are comonly use and you will never find in a dictionary even more i could show you a lot of meanings that words in spanish have different from those in the dictionary ok tell me how many people in zionist movements define a jew in a different way and how many are who define jew based on a religious way i don't think that data exist on this directly and guess why isn't it curious that we do not know how many people define in how many different ways the term jew which is the basis of the movement itself so the evidence shows that up to now jew when considered in terms of israel the law of return and jewish nationality is defined in terms of religion and not of cultural identity even if NUM of those defined as jews in isreal are not religious in the same way i believe that irish have a right to nationalism but i do not support the bombing and killing of the ira i believe that jews have a right to nationalism but i do not support zionism as it is right now comparing the actions of israel to that of the ira is like comparing those of the us to those of chile under pinochet for example with the ira in the role of pinochet you really need to get your history straight you also need a basic dictionary you need to start reading before answering my point was that because some movement claims to be nationalistic it does not mean that i consider it to be nationalistic i did not comapre israel to the ira i think that you are starting to put words on my mouth and that is wrong that is no problem but once again you are defining zionism as one movement you are implying that it is monolithic you know this is not and has never been the case that is a problem i am saying that i do not support zionism as it is now i believe that among the people in the soviet communist party some might even had been inspired by noble ideals does that change the final results of what happened in the ussr in the same way even if the zionist movement is not homogeneous it does not matter what matters is the result i never said that zionism is monolithic if you are going to attribute me things present the quotes where i said that you don't say it directly you implied it and i showed explicitly where and how you implied it now you're trying to wriggle out of it won't wash and you know it i never said it directly nor indirectly i am not talking about individuals who defined themselves as zionists here i am sure most of them are good honest and caring people i am talking about the results of the zionist movement i am talking about a movement whose actions resulted in a law of return with a religious definition of jew a country that defines nationality based on religion i am talking about something i consider a form of racism such as differenciation based on religious belief after all if arabs in israel cannot serve in the army is becasue they were not born in the right religion what you said is that judaism is defined according to religious standards now this can have several different meanings and you know it one of the meanings that it can have is to say that only those who are religious are defined as jews another is to say that only those who meet the religious definition of a jew is one and there are others i'm not twisting your words i'm trying to make you aware that your words don't mean what you think they do i had never heard the definition only those who are religious are defined as jews i had always seen the definition a person is a jew is hisher mother iswas a jew and if such person does not convert although i had seen people argue about the last part i am not talking about the debate i am talking about how things are right now when the debate is over i'll see what happens right now things are like they are let me ask you one thing i understand that israel differenciates between citizenship and nationality suppose male and female have a child in israel which nationality will the child's id show according to each one of the following cases actually it doesn't and the citizens' rights are exactly the same in both cases anyway so there is no difference between citizenship and nationality in israel or what do you mean by actually it doesn't a f and m are both jewish jewish b f is jewsh and m is not jewish c f is muslim and m is jewish d f is christian and m is jewish it'll depend on what religion is practiced in the house the original law of return would still admit such a person if they were jewish if memory serves so it follows a religious definition and not a cultural one that is what i call a form of racism i do not know why you are so touchy i never said that you did not support palestinian selfdetermination i just gave an example of hypocrisy no you didn't you had to twist the definition of the word NUM degrees in order to do so and everyone else knows it i'm not being touchy you do not need to assume the representation of everybody else to make your points you should assume that you are just talking for yourself about the other stuff i still believe that the example was a valid one it would be a hypocrisy to say that one supports nationalism for all and then support zionism and then disregard the palestinian's right i never said that someone in this net is guilty of it it was just an example nothing more nothing less than that why did you have to clarify what you think because what you gave was not an example it was an example of how the definition of a word can be twisted around NUM degrees it was an example you are trying to justify something nobody has talked about first you should know that words have more meanings than those given in the dictionary oh so now what are dictionaries for reference it's not nonsense when people read what you write they have to try to associate a meaning to those words dictionaries give the meanings of words don't they yes but not all of them a language is something that evolves all the time it seems that you cannot answer to the ideas given by others without insulting others sad not at all what i cannot abide is utter bombast when you've been proven completely wrong not really i posted in another post the definition of zionism and in this post you have showed for me what i was telling you from the begining zionism is a form of racism even if most zionists are not racist in their individual and private lifes a movement that ask for a state and national rights for a people and then in practice that people are defined according to religion is for me racistlike i never put even one syllable in your mouth you have tried to prove this and you

research cprigcapcorg writes by elias davidsson april NUM revision oct NUM note you are already posting facts some of which are outdated the biased presentation of facts as well as the conclusions that you reach leave me little hope of engaging in any fruitful exchange that might lead to a meeting of the minds it is to those who read with open mind that i address myself the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination adopted by the general assembly of the united nations in NUM has now been ratified by most member states article NUM of this convention defines the term racial discrimination as any distinction exclusion restriction or preference based on race colour descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political economic social cultural or any other field of public life while the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals as the text currently stands i know of no country in which racial discrimination of some sort can not be found it makes no mention of the need for for a legislative violation the general assembly endorsed in NUM a resolution defining zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination the important correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since it does not include operative statements designed to end israeli racial discrimination meanwhile the united states on behalf of israel are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the united nations to repeal this resolution and give israeli racial practices zionism moral legitimacy if you are in principle advocating un intervention via operative statements in this case it must therefore hold that they can be applied to any other case where the council perceives some form of racial discrimination as previously exhibited scarey thought the very definition of israel as a state belonging to the jews of the world but not to its inhabitants alienates all native nonjews born in that country actually i know quite a few native nonjews born in israel that are not alienated by this law if you had said some you would probably be correct however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes apparent this slant permeates the text practically all nonjews who are living in or originate from areas under israeli control identify themselves as palestinians most of them are muslim many are christian a few jews including the author of these lines also identify themselves as palestinians the above statement is not true practically all discounting beduins circassians druze and some other fringe groups your own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the issue you could equally identify yourself as a insert group zionism took off in europe at the end of last century it's aim was to create a jewish state in palestine in spite of the adamant opposition of palestinian arabs NUM of the population if i recall correctly at the time zionism took off there was no adamant opposition in palestine i am open to any factual contradictory evidence but the zionists were more powerful militarily economically and technologically and succeeded in NUM in conquering NUM of the area of mandatory palestine after driving into exile most native arabs from the conquered areas approximately NUM people and razing most of their villages to the ground the zionists could finally establish a predominantly jewish state only NUM nonjews remained on israeli territory do you therefore contend that the NUM villages you mention further on most of their villages once the jewish state was established it began enacting laws to help the confiscation of land from native nonjews their political repression and their destitution there is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later used for these purposes however you seem to imply that this was the intention a priori which implies a policy and agenda my knowledge was that this was not the case you also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded this as you do again below in NUM the state of israel invaded egypt and syria and occupied the rest of palestine the west bank and the gaza strip thus another NUM million palestinians fell under its juridiction its occupation of palestinian and other arab territories is considered illegal by the international community as reflected in security council resolutions israel has rejected all un resolutions and began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time not quite accurate israel has not rejected all the resolutions though it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them israel never annexed the sinai west bank or gaza the other annexations were brought about partly due to the un resolutions part of these territores east jerusalem and the golan heights have already been forcefully annexed by israel in defiance of international law and un resolutions out of curiousity provided that the annexees are granted citizenship what int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories captured in war has this ever been applied to any other country previously other than iraq it must be emphasized that although these people live under different regimes they are united in their selfperception as palestinians that is as people identifying with palestine a territorial entity not an ethnic or religious entity incorrect palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against on an ethnic or racial basis therefore your above statement is incorrect i also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination the only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically however no such nation has existed it definitely did not exist at the time of the creation of israel in which case you can not argue racial discrimination during that period furthermore palestinians generally consider the plo both as a symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that represents them in world affairs once again some do some don't the nonjewish population living in the palestinian and other arab territories occupied by israel in NUM suffers not only blatant discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation another generalization but then again you don't seem to care about anyone other than the palestinian people whose cause you espouse licence to start a business and to buy industrial equipment the right to educate children all of these basic rights are subject to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be challenged in court incorrect once again they have the ability to appeal furthermore although you may not agree with them not all of the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary some are but this is not due to the whims of the military as much as the sizeof the taskorganization only jewish inhabitants of the occupied territories are permitted to carry firearms incorrect once again i know two arab policemen who lived in daheisha and there were more of course with the outbreak of the intifada they were forced by the locals to resign bitterly jewish settlers have right to NUM more water per person than nonjews jewish residents of these territories number now about NUM people it is israel governmentus policy to increase this number substantially in total defiance of international law un resolutions and the will of the population the state of israel systematically confiscates land from nonjewish inhabitants of these territories for jewish settlement that is no longer true and i can't help but wonder what your purpose iswas in posting this some NUM people in israel properare not jews most of them consider themselves palestinians with israeli citizenship for many years after the establishment of israel they were subjected to harsh military control much of their land was confiscated by the state and handed to jewish organisations for exclusive jewish settlement they have been subject to massacres destitution and humiliation while they enjoy with jewish israelis the right to vote they are discriminated against both through law and in practice once again to hell with the other minorities that don't fit in right their are many villages who did not suffer in the way you seem to indicate abu gosh comes to mind yes some did but as a result of what actions approximately NUM of the surface of the state of israel within the rgreen lines is for all purposes closed to palestinians who are secondclass citizens in israel they may neither legally live on such land nor rent or cultivate it a direct effect of these policies is that native nonjewish citizens of israel are denied residence and membership rights in most rural communities in israel including the collective settlements kibbutzim nonjews are discriminated against in many other ways the government starves local authorities of palestinian villages and townships of funds jewish city councils force palestinians to live in ghettos jewish families receive higher child allocations than their nonjewish neighbors palestinian schools suffer underfunding and understaffing as compared to jewish schools palestinian children are denied the right to learn their history and literature israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end of racial discrimination suffer continuous harassment by the authorities NUM there are some kibbutzim with arabnonjewish members it is up to the members of the kibbutz there is no legislation against it nor against a purely nonjewish collective NUM funds are the result of political lobbying bearing in mind that nonjews compose NUM of the voting population it has never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large bloc and increase their power the recent elections are a case in point NUM please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation with regard to educational material you have obviously never seen the curriculum of a school in the west bank it is based upon jordan's school system NUM with regard to your last statement it is simply another gross generalization the state of israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the state of all its inhabitants although the israeli cabinet has never openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea the forced removal from the country of its native palestinian population that is its ultimate judaization israeli government policies towards nonjews bear the mark of this 'final solution' no attempt is made by the zionist authorities to integrate palestinian arabs into israeli public life thus although comprising approximately NUM of the population of israeli citizens no palestinian citizen of israel has ever served as cabinet member as director of ministry or of a national institution as judge of the supreme court as ambassador of israel or in any leading position in israeli economic or financial life even the director of the ministry for arab affairs yes such a thing exists is a jew another generalization but lets not stop here the transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't moledet it was intended to be a solution to the problem in the territories not the country itself with regard to other items i recall at least one arab ambassador and the rest was covered previously although sexual relations between and cohabitation of jews and nonjews are legal they are considered by israelizionist society somewhat a betrayal of the jewish and zionist ethics the israeli educational system nurtures this attitude in a systematic way when was the last time you were in israel that is simply not true nor has it been for quite some time the question of religious intervention is best answered by the proportional representation and the lack of any arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state based on equality of all citizens this is one main reason why israel has not produced any written constitution simply incorrect the answer is political once again your failure to understand the dynamics and movements inside israeli gov't relegates your contentions to the sidelines zionism predicates a state where jews have privileged rights thus according to israeli law a jew born in london who has never visited israel does not speak hebrew and professes atheism is granted automatic israeli citizenship while native palestinian inhabitants who happen to be christian or muslim are treated almost as aliens racial discrimination as defined in international law is thus not only reflected in israeli laws and policies but is grounded in the very nature of israel as a jewish state but the discrimination is not based upon race oops sorry nasty habit i have of countering malicious false truths any proposal for israeliarab and israelipalestinian peace that does not address the issue of racial discrimination by israel that is the zionist nature of the state of israel is thus doomed to fail real world intrusion any proposal that does is doomed to fail of

policyimportant labour's enclaves policy in the occupied territories by israel shahak publ in middle east international london NUM it is not difficult to discover israel's policy towards the palestinians at any given time it can be easily inferred from the facts on the ground and from the information provided by the hebrew press there is one condition though the torrents of claptrap about the peace process must be totally ignored as must israel's official pronouncements whole sole purpose is to distort reality by concentrating only on the facts it was early apparent that labour's policies were no different from those of shamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their more effective implementation likud's policies were accurately described by ariel sharon in an article accompanied by a map in yediot aharonot last august the sharon plan envisaged a division of the west bank into seven and the gaza strip into four autonomous palestinian enclaves all of them under israeli supervision the total area of these enclaves amounted to about NUM per cent of the territories the rest was to be controlled by the israeli settlements and the highways built around the enclaves the entire area around jerusalem from the outskirts of ramallah to the boundaries of bethlehem has already been turned into a greater jerusalem where the arab inhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded by areas occupied by israeli settlements or reserved for them judging from labour's settlement policy it may be assumed that it may content itself with a lesser number of arab enclaves of a rather larger size than sharon had planned but the principle of surrounding the enclaves by settlements strategically dispersed along the highways remains unchanged labour plans only four enclaves in the west bank two in samaria and two in judea ie north and south of jerusalem respectively and no more than two in the gaza strip in regard to greater jerusalem labour's policies hardly deviate from sharon's a saner version of likud policy as some israeli correspondents at once realised labour policies were but a saner version of sharon's extravaganza last july gideon eshet wrote in yediot aharonot that while barely a few months ago labour supported the demand to freeze all construction beyond the green line no specific decision to freeze construction in the territories has been taken and uzi benziman wrote in ha'aretz that as far as can be judged on the basis of the internal political discussions in jerusalem rabin intends to stick to likud's ways the two biggest enclaves envisaged by labour are located in samaria therefore the belt of settlements around the transsamaria highway designed to separate those enclaves from each other is of paramount importance according to the latest data the percentage of israeli settlers in the entire west bank population apart from east jerusalem is a mere NUM per cent but for the area around the transsamaria highway the corresponding figure is almost NUM per cent and it is increasing steadily the situation in the settlements of the efrat block south of jerusalem designed to sever the enclave around bethlehem from the one around hebron is pretty much the same the efrat block is now being connected with west jerusalem by a highway the project is costly in the extreme because the highway is designed to bypass bethlehem by a sequence of long tunnels the final decision to build this highway was suspended until rabin's return from his us visit in march the subsequent decision to renew its construction can be seen as us approval for the enclaves plan as a whole process of impoverishment the enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady impoverishment of the palestinians this is well known in israel but ignored abroad by all who should be concerned including the plo in regard to the gaza strip the whole process was best described by ze'ev shiff in ha'aretz in march he mentions having seen a pamphlet issued six years ago by the civil administration forecasting the conditions in the gaza strip under israeli rule in NUM his analysis deserves to be quoted extensively we continue to steal the strip's water even though its quality deteriorates from year to year we continue to steal the strip's tiny land resources in order to found there more and more settlements as if we deliberately want to make the inhabitants despair and in their despair think in termws of having nothing to lose it is by our own doing that the strip's workers must now spend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time as they spend working from the military point of view we have kept control of no more than half the strip's area at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and resources about a year before moshe arens left the defence ministry i heard him saying that we should withdraw from the strip come what may his argument was that israel sinks into the strip ever deeper and deeper he told me he had proposed this to yitzhak shamir but he rejected it yitzhak rabin rejects it too enormous state support for the qatif block settlers can also be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being implemented the qatif block settlements founded by the first rabin government of NUM are intended to divide the gaza strip into two separate enclaves efraim davidi of davar had data showing how vital for israeli this enterprise is the qatif block is now producing NUM per cent of israeli tomatoes destined for export and a substantial proportion of cut flowers he also deals with the subsidies the settlers receive considerably augmented by the present government owing to them housing units are cheap the present government does not spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block any prospective settler will get a NUM per cent mortgage for his house on top of a grant of NUM shekels NUM such data shows that israel's plans apply whether the palestinians of the gaza strip are allowed or forbidden to work in israel the economic motivations were explained by danny rubinstein in ha'aretz in march from the economic viewpoint gaza could already be sealed off hermetically and all the strip's workers could be barred from entering israeleven though accurate data is hard to come by it is indisputable that during the last two years the numbes of gazan workers arriving daily to work in israel has markedly decreased from NUM in the mid'80s to NUM today but the decrease is not only due to restrictions imposed on entering israel from gaza it is also due to the drastic curtailment of demand for gazan labour in israel with unemployment in israel soaring and the construction of apartments blocks virtually halted the workers from gaza are no longer really needed gaza's total dependence the entire economy of the gaza strip is totally dependent on israel in recent years in the gaza strip there has been an increase in subcontracted work for israeli factories mostly footware and textiles thousands of small workshops employing an average of four workers get their raw materials or unfinished products together with detailed working instructions from israeli factories rubinstein attributes this development to the fact that the average wage in the gaza strip is merely NUM per cent of that in the west bank which in turn stands at half the average wage in israel and besides the gazan employer does not pay any social security for his employees if the average wage in the gaza strip is just a fifth of that in israel the profits of israeli factories and even of palestinian subcontractors must be vast they are higher still when a gazan subcontractor provides labour to be performed at home with the family's help the livelihood of tens of thousands of gazans depends on such subcontracted work many of them are women and children paid about ten shekels NUM a day which can last NUM hours or more there can be no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap gazan labour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition of rabin and other israeli ministers to withdrawal from the strip economic conditions in the gaza strip differ little from what was created straight after israel's conquest in NUM in this respect one should not be deluded by the talk nowadays fashionable about israeli gestures intended to encourage economic development in the territories as israeli journalists point out all permits for opening new businesses depend on a prior approval by the shin bet behind all the professed goodwill there is no desire to solve problems just the attitude of a good colonialist willing to do something for the benefit of the natives but on condition that they behave nicely do not become rebellious and never do anything against the interests of the metropolis its economic interests included wrote michal sela in davar in february the development of subcontracted work in the gaza strip accords perfectly with sela's diagnosis sela also shows how exactly the economic controls work in all branches of the economy lobbies have been set in motion for purposes of freeing israeli production from the threat of any palestinian competition the method is simplicity itself as soon as any israeli producer succeeds in persuading the government or even the trade and industry minister alone a military order is issued prohibiting the export of a given produce to israel if this does not suffice a palestinian factory may be denied a licence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse its production among the most active of such lobbies is the agricultural one it has succeeded in limiting exports of gazan vegetables except for those grown by settlers not only to israel but also to europe where they otherwise might compete with israeli exports perpetuaring apartheid labour's goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in the territories the same goal is shared by the us which otherwise could not support the labour government so firmly in my view one of the reasons the us feels happier about supporting labour than likud is its greater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive this point was brought home by ofer shelah in ma'ariv who deplored the settlers' failure which he attributed to likud's inefficiency he showed that the peak yearly settlement growth occured during the term of office of the national unity government ie NUM in which rabin served throughout as the defence minister likud's reputation for settling the territories better than labour is false attributable to the many tiny settlements without strategic value founded under shamir for symbolic reasons to sum up labour's policy unconditionally supported by the us differs from that of likud primarily in the efficiency with which it is implemented according to that policy the territories are to be divided into two parts the major part is to be ruled by israel directly and the minor part indirectly in my view this racist scheme is doomed to ultimately fail but at a horrifying price in human suffering the sooner its true nature is recognised the less suffering it may cause\",\n",

be worse there you'll be safer at home he said don't be afraid if something happens i'll send people to save you after he left about NUM minutes passed and about NUM people burst into our courtyard all of us were at home at the time igor and i and our two children ira and edik and their daughter my sisterinlaw ira and my motherand fatherinlaw and the ambartsumian family there were three of them uncle misha zhasmen and their daughter marina now when they started breaking down the door i remember edik and igor told us go in that room and close the door close the door and calm the children so they won't hear that there's anyone home the children started crying suddenly ira my brotherinlaw's wife suggested let's run out onto the balcony we the two daughtersinlaw and the children and zhasmen and marina raced out onto the balcony my sisterinlaw and my motherinlaw ran in and said quick over to the other balcony or they'll kill you all we lived on the second floor we needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor's at first we couldn't manage it the balcony looked onto the street at that time people were coming home from work and many just stood there watching i pleaded and begged please call someone have someone come i even started shouting i'll throw down the children i'll throw them down you catch them and take them somewhere so at least the children will survive either they were afraid or i don't know what they looked as though they were watching a movie some of them started throwing stones at us i'll say it again these weren't the bandits these were people from the other part of the building and from our entryway they were just regular people passersby a bus even stopped i remember a man's voice saying the armenians were climbing over to the other balcony ira my sisterinlaw helped us get the children over there i was pregnant about seven months pregnant no it wasn't yet seven it was six and a half i climbed over too i think zhasmen went first you know i just don't remember it all that well zhasmen went first i think and edik's wife ira and i had the children and they were all screaming and crying my kristina said mamma don't throw us over the balcony we're afraid lilia was crying and kristina and seryozha were crying too kristina didn't even want to climb over she shouted i'm staying with grandmother i'm staying with grandma she loved her grandma more than she loved me and my motherinlaw shouted oh no kristina's still there she's still there save kristina too ira helped us climb over with kristina coming last ira helped us and went back inside we started pounding on the neighbor's balcony door i pounded with my fist sevil open the door open it please she didn't open it no go away go anywhere go i'm not opening the door she was our neighbor we were friends we never refused her anything ever and apparently she thought we were going to break the windows and she opened the door she opened it and said karina karina go away go anywhere just don't stay here they'll kill us too because of you i begged please at least take the children we'll leave we'll go back no she said you have to leave her sons ran in one had a knife sevil's brother he's around NUM shouted at us get out of here leave i'll kill you with this knife i became terrified i took the children and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs i went down and heard a loudspeaker it was in the courtyard the armenians must be killed they've taken all the best places all the best apartments one of them said let the armenian blood flow none of them should survive when i heard that i went upstairs and started knocking on doors no one opened their door for me not on the third floor or the fourth i couldn't see zhasmen any longer ira came upstairs later i even thought that they had let her stay that they would save her my head was spinning they were killing my family and here i was in the next entryway with two children seryozha was four and kristina was five and a half they were crying mamma we're scared they were so frightened that i didn't even know how to calm them should i try to calm them or myself it was awful but on the third floor a man did open his door i asked open up let me inside he opened the door slightly and said no no and that was it he said it so sternly no i went up to the fifth floor i pounded my fists on the door with all my might he opened up the man of the house and stood there looking at me i was ready to get down on my knees i almost did get down on my knees please i beg of you at least take the children he wasn't an azerbaijani he was a lezgin i don't even know how but he let me inside and when i went in zhasmen was already there two minutes hadn't passed when ira and lilia came up the stairs lilia was crying he didn't want to open the door and again i started pleading please open the door it's our ira and lilia open the door and he said no i'm afraid i said again and again please open the door please he looked at me he looked at me for a long time and then opened the door after all ira came in with lilia we threw ourselves into each other's arms crying then the man locked us into the bathroom we sat there for a long time through the door he told us calm the children and calm yourselves down too calm down this man was hiding us but what of our family when i was still in our apartment i had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive i said igor edik let's say farewell and edik turned around and looked at me as if to say is that some kind of joke all the same i thought they would kill all of us igor looked at me too but it was already too late they started pounding on the door igor was standing next to the door before that he had told us go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight he thought we were in the room but before we went out onto the balcony we went to them edik igor let's say farewell igor didn't think we could climb over to the other balcony and we did get over there and i myself can't believe we were able to save ourselves igor put on a helmet and edik had his coat on and he put on a fur hat all the menigor edik their father and misha ambartsumianthey all stood next to the door they thought they would pound on it a while and leave but from the other side of the door they ordered in azerbaijani open the door we were all silent waiting someone outside the door said they're home they're in there break down the door and i remember my fatherinlaw whispering they're going to break it down now it's coming down now he had something in his hands i think it was a knife if they got in we were going to defend ourselves in the hall near the door there were two metal chair legs from outside the door they said we're counting to five open up but we were all quiet we didn't answer them we made like no one was home we figured they'd leave they'd get tired and leave my fatherinlaw had said it's not possible they'd come into my home how can that be everyone knows us all of sumgait knows our family we are on good terms with everyone and indeed a day did not pass that there wasn't an azerbaijani guest at our table we had a nice dacha everyone would get together there often azerbaijanis liked being with us there too but now we had to save ourselves we had to flee from our own home ira i remember said i'm not leaving here my brothers and my parents are here i'm going to fight alongside them that's just what she said she picked up a knife and said if they open the door and come into the apartment then i'm going to fight alongside my family i'm not going anywhere we were at sevil's when they broke into our apartment we heard fighting and shouting the noise was terrible and when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor at the lezgin's apartment you could hear everything up there too even ira's voice i remember her calling her mother several times she called her for a long time i started pounding on the door in the bathroom open the door what are they doing to ira who's shouting that's ira shouting that's her voice but the lezgin said it's nothing calm down no it's not in your apartment he was lying to me so i'd calm down two hours went by and the lezgin opened the door and said karina igor got away calm down he ran away he saw igor break away and run off with his own eyes they killed him outside next to the building while we were in the bathroom i experienced every possible human terror the way ira shouted she shouted save me mamma save me mamma mamma she repeated it several times there was a wild din there were very many people there all of them shouting all of them bellowing howling whistlingyou just can't imagine what was going on what the roar was like apparently after they had killed ira those murderers came into the entryway where we were hiding and came upstairs all the way up to the fifth floor i don't know if they were just looking for any armenians or for us in particular but i think they were looking for us because when we had climbed over the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughtersinlaw were climbing over the balconies and after we heard ira we heard them coming up the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors i thought those were our last moments and started saying goodbye to my children kissing them they were sleeping i woke them up kristina seryozha wake up and i tell ira ira if something happens we'll throw ourselves off the balcony we were on the fifth floor apparently our lezgin neighbor had opened the door too because later he said i opened the door and told them there were no armenians inside and after they all left our neighbor went out on the balcony himself to see they were gone we weren't friends with those lezgin neighbors we only knew each other from the building but the people we were friends with wouldn't even consider hiding us the lezgin let us out of the bathroom they had a candle burning he said karina there're no lights on in our block the whole block was dark the whole block it's a huge block too the lezgin said i'm afraid to keep you until morning i'm afraid of the neighbors they might kill me for saving you i said what are you saying we'll leave now but we can't just leave with the children in the middle of the night give us time to find somewhere else to hide he said well ok go look i asked ira ira do you want to go ira said no i'll stay with the children karina i said fine then i'll go zhasmen and i went downstairs together it was very dark no one was in the courtyard it was dark pitch black l was afraid to go out at after seven igor always met me after work and accompanied me home i never went out alone and now here i was out in the middle of the night and after a slaughter like that too it was probably after eleven later i called the boarding school and my director answered he said karina where are you i didn't know i was calling from a public phone outside and didn't know where i was i got confused and hung up the receiver from him i only found out what time it was i asked him what time is it he said NUM i think but i don't really remember so anyway zhasmen and i went out into the courtyard i look and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment and there was the smell of something burnt i became horrified i looked at the corpse for a long time it was either ira or edik i only saw one of them zhasmen grabbed my hand and squeezed it hurry up let's go hurry up come on what are you turning around for i turned around and saw a large truck it must have belonged to the bandits because they came to kill us in a truck like that we lived in the third entryway and that truck was next to the fourth we walked quickly holding hands i thought if i go to the police then they'll put me away i couldn't count on them before i reached the police station i saw a military vehicle we went over and i said soldier in block NUM i don't know if they've killed people or injured themwe need to save them and he said go to the police station and tell them everything i said i'm afraid to go there i'm afraid of them he said don't be afraid we went to the police and they wrote down the address and the military vehicle went to our building i didn't go with them they left me at the police station i gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that they'd rescue them too i didn't know where they were or what had happened to them after a while they brought my children and ira and lilia first they took us to the kgb that was at two or three in the morning then around five they took us to the city party committee and there were very many people there very many i was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress seryozha was only wearing a shirt and kristina had a little dress on no coat no boots nothing and we sat there for three whole days in the city party committee the lezgin had told me that igor escaped and i thought that he was probably alive but then after two and a half days they took us the armenians of sumgait to nasosny on march NUM some people from the central committee came and told us karina ira we need you come with us to the city party committee my mamma had come to nasosny and she had been looking for me for six days mama my brothers and my uncle we went to the city party committee and waited there in the courtyard i was wearing nothing but a dress and ira had only a dress on as well there was a strong wind on march NUM an hour went by and then one of the functionaries told us karina ira gather your courage would you like to go to the burial i said what did they really kill all of them he said let's look he had a long list and he started reading them off igor melkumian my husband eduard melkumian my brotherin law irina melkumian my sisterinlaw sogomon melkumian my fatherinlaw and raisa melkumian my motherinlaw he read off all their names and said get in the car let's go to the burial we buried our family i couldn't believe it at the time i couldn't conceive of it or imagine it and even now i think how shall i explain it to my children when they're older my children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and grandmother kristina didn't love me the way she loved her grandfather and grandmother they spoiled her kristina would always announce my grandma is better than anyone now even though she is getting used to my mother it's difficult for her and once she told her you're a bad grandmother i don't know why i asked her kristina where's papa and she said they

of the sultan starting with the greek revolution early in the nineteenth century which based on the megali idea or great idea sought to add to greek kingdom istanbul and large portions of anatolia union of which with greece was felt to be the 'dream and hope of all' the success of the greek national movement provided more in fact by the intervention of the great powers than by the efforts of the greeks themselves stimulated similar uprisings among the other subjects in southeastern europe who had long been oppressed not so much by the ottomans but rather by the greek religious hierarchy which dominated the orthodox millet leading first to pressure for religious independence granted to the bulgarian orthodox exarchate in NUM to the serbian church in NUM and to the rumanian church in NUM with subsequent aspirations for and achievement of political independence following page NUM they new nationalist leaders were greatly assisted in their campaigns against the ottomans both by the

fortified the religious as well as ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence christian nationalism based as much on religious as on ethnic identity soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both jews and muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past vicious antimuslim and antisemitic movements developed involving largescale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies by the independent states that resulted also by christian subjects who remained within the empire particularly because of jewish and muslim support for ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent nationalist states of southeastern europe the results were explosive and damaging the invading armies of russia and austria as well as the revolting nationalists

in the treaties of paris NUM and berlin NUM page NUM as the peoples of southeastern europe achieved their independence their muslim and jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and massacred and those who survived were driven beyond the evershrinking boundaries of the retreating ottoman empire in a kind of slaughter which had not been seen since the dispersal of the jews from palestine centuries earlier this sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth century with the rumanian principalities taking the lead as united rumania did subsequently during the later

town on the mainland and from island to island in the agean exterminating all the jews and muslims they could find many along the roads as they desperately fled to safety in what was left of the ottoman empire contemporary accounts relate that the greeks left the murdered jews and muslims lying exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards NUM most of the jews who survived these

pretexts for attacking and ravaging jewish quarters as well as for new tactics for boycotting jewish shopkeepers merchants and professionals a movement which was quickly adapted by the christian millets in the major cities of the ottoman empire because the bulgarians rumanians and greeks correctly regarded the jews as supporters of the turks both jews and turks were expelled from these countries in equally atrocious and brutal manners their property was plundered and their homes and shops taken over without compensation while the survivors fled in desperation to edirne and istanbul

it no less difficult to give a platform to arabs from the territories seemingly two entirely different matters but in fact they are one and the same the 13th knesset proved last week that even though one third of its members are new faces it has not renewed its own face at all at least on one issue parliamentary traditions may be modernized and parliamentary traditions may become obsolete and only one tradition endures forever no arab shall set foot in the more important committees of the house there has never been and never will be an arab mk on the external affairs and defense committee or on the finance committee worlds have been overturned over the question of whether or not to give arabs for the first time a place on the state comptroller's committee the arguments are old and wellknown in all three of the above committees innumerable secrets are revealed and woe unto us if an arab should hear them one must not make light of such arguments but their significance should also not be exaggerated every arab mk is not spending all his time waiting for the opportune moment to hand over information from the knesset committee room to black panther headquarters in jenin and not all the aforementioned committees are continually occupied in the discussion of topsecret matters which could safely be revealed for example to mks supportive of the jewish underground but not to an arab mk from the likud labor or even from hadash the arabs themselves would probably forego membership in the subcommittee on secret service matters but what would happen one may ask if mk nawaf masalha were to hear god forbid a review of the foreign minister in an open meeting of the foreign affairs and defense committee or even a review of the army chief of staff which in any case are regularly leaked to the next edition of the news and what would happen if mk hashem mahamid were to report on what he had seen with his own eyes at alnajah their nonparticipation in important committees and that of their colleagues creates an intolerable situation where arab members of the elected house have only semipositions they are good enough for addressing plenary sessions and for voting for or against the government and participating in the deliberations of the immigration and absorption committee but they must not for example participate in the process of formulating the state budget in the finance committee or in the allocation of resources to local authorities in any case they have little part in that labor's dependence on the support of the arab parties has brought about some improvement mk hashem mahamid will it seems participate in the state comptroller's committee earlier there had been a ridiculous attempt made to dictate to hadash who their representative should be and thus to prevent the arab from entering this dubious holyofholies but it soon became clear that there was no legal or constitutional backing for such a step but not to worry even now the jewish mind is contriving devices the new committee chair roni milo has already announced that he will set up subcommittees aplenty for his committee thus he will decide where it is permissible for mahamid to participate and where not a solution such as this could by the way also have been adopted for the rest of the committees thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secrets being leaked to the

armenian was permitted to approach the city and its environs while the commander of the first army corps general kaltiyin remained in power troops including armenian enlisted men were not sent to the area when the security measures were lifted the armenians began to attack erzurum and its surroundings following the attacks came the plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder of the owners of these housesplundering was widely committed by the soldiers this plunder was mainly committed by armenian soldiers who had remained in the rear during the war one day while passing through the streets on horseback a group of soldiers including an armenian soldier began to drag two old men of seventy years in a certain direction the roads were covered with mud and these people were dragging the two helpless turks through the mud and dirt it was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and traps the turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds and withdrew the reason was that most of the turks who were on night patrol did not return and no one knew what had happened to them the turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear also finally the court martial which had been established for the trials of murderers and plunderers began to liquidate itself for fear that they themselves would be punished the incidents of murder and rape which had decreased began to occur more frequently sometime in january and february a leading turkish citizen haci bekir efendi from erzurum was killed one night at his

enlisted men had reached its highest point that they had insulted and robbed the people and half of the turks sent outside the city had not returned we learnt the details this incident from the commanderinchief odishelidge they were as follows the killings were organized by the doctors and the employers and the act of killing was committed solely by the armenian renegades more than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless turks have been killed in erzincan large holes were dug and the defenceless turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes later the murdered turks were thrown into the holes the armenian who stood near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses 'seventy dead bodies well this hole can take ten more' thus ten more turks would be cut into pieces thrown into the hole and when the hole was full it would be covered over with soil the armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently fill a house with eighty turks and cut their heads off one by one following the erzincan massacre the armenians began to withdraw towards erzurum the armenian renegades among those who withdrew to erzurum from erzincan raided the moslem villages on the road and destroyed the entire population together with the villages during the transportation of the cannons ammunition and the carriages that were outside the war area certain people were hired among the kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages while the travellers were passing through erzurum the armenians took advantage of the time when the russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill the kurds they had hired when the russian soldiers heard the cries of the dying kurds they attempted to help them however the armenians threatened the russian soldiers by vowing that they would have the same fate if they intervened and thus prevented them from acting all these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with hatred and loathing lieutenant medivani from the russian army described an incident that he witnessed in erzurum as follows an armenian had shot a kurd the kurd fell down but did not die the armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying kurd however since the kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony the armenian failed in his attempt having seen this the armenian ripped open the abdomen of the kurd disembowelled him and finally killed him by stamping him with the iron heel of his boot odishelidge himself told us that all the turks who could not escape from the village of ilica were killed their heads had been cut off by axes he also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered children lieutenant colonel gryaznov who passed through the village of ilica three weeks after the massacre told us the following there were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces on the roads every armenian who happened to pass through these roads cursed and spat on the corpses in the courtyard of a mosque which was about 25x30 meter square dead bodies were piled to a height of NUM centimeters among these corpses were men and women of every age children and old people the women's bodies had obvious marks of rape the genitals of many girls were filled with gunpowder a few educated armenian girls who worked as telephone operators for the armenian troops were called by lieutenant colonel gryaznov to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be proud of what the armenians had done to the lieutenant colonel's disgusted amazement the armenian girls started to laugh and giggle instead of being horrified the lieutenant colonel had severely reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour when he told the girls that the armenians including women were generally more licentious than even the wildest animals and that their indecent and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity and barbarity before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers the armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and claimed they had laughed because they were nervous an armenian contractor at the alaca communication zone command narrated the

entire population of tepekoy village situated within the artillery area had been totally annihilated on the same day when antranik entered erzurum i reported the massacre to him and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible act however no result was achieved in the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred there was a natural silence on the night of NUM february the armenians deceived the russians perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the turkish soldiers later it was understood that this massacre had been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular the population had been herded in a certain place and then killed one by one the number of murders committed on that night reached three thousand it was the armenians who bragged to about the details of the massacre the armenians fighting against the turkish soldiers were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even withstand the turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred people and two cannons for one night and ran away the leading armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre however the armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with the renegades in this massacre just as in all the others the lower classes within the armenian community have always obeyed the orders of the leading armenian figures and commanders i do not like to give the impression that all armenian intellectuals were accessories to these murders no for there were people who opposed the armenians for such actions since they understood that it would yield no result however such people were only a minority furthermore such people were considered as traitors to the armenian cause some have seemingly opposed the armenian murders but have supported the massacres secretly some on the other hand preferred to remain silent there were certain others who when accused by the russians of infamy would say the following 'you are russians you can never understand the

today scattered among its ruins p NUM first and second paragraphs we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work of

inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work some of the tartars escaped of course they found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into turkey the rest were killed and so it is that the whole length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of tartar villages they are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead p NUM

their flocks and herds from valley to valley from plain to mountain and from mountain to plain following the pasturage as it changed with the seasons they ranged from the salt desert shores of the caspian sea far into the mighty caucasus mountains even the village tartars are a primitive people only semicivilized i can see now that we armenians frankly despised the tartars and while holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country regarded and treated them as inferiors the fact that the russians looked down upon all armenians in much the same way as armenians regarded tartars far from proving a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors intensified an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility p NUM second paragraph our men armed themselves gathered together and advanced on the tartar section of the village there were no lights in the houses and the doors were barred for the tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great fear our men hammered on the doors but got no response whereupon they smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last tartar was slain throughout the hideous night i

the members of the dashnack party were without administrative experience consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself incompetent to rule by legitimate means the members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and outside the law when they became a legally instituted recognized governing body with the destiny of armenia in their hands they proved incompetent to do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their fight against the russian and turkish governments in their outlaw days the outstanding feature of their rule now that they were in power was as in the old days trial and execution without hearing a man evoking the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him the method of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the condemned man in his home or on the street place a pistol to the back of his head and

the worst outrage of the fouryear war over nagorny karabakh the figure is drawn from azeri investigators hojali officials and casualty lists published in the baku press diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates the NUM february attack on hojali by armenian forces was one of the last moves in their fouryear campaign to take full control of nagorny karabakh the subject of a new round of negotiations in rome on monday the bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and a massacre but investigators say that most of the dead were civilians the awful number of people killed was first suppressed by the fearful former communist government in baku later it was blurred by armenian denials and griefstricken azerbaijan's wild and contradictory allegations of up to NUM dead the state prosecuter aydin rasulov the cheif investigator of a 15man team looking into what azerbaijan calls the hojali disaster said his figure of NUM people dead was a minimum on preliminary findings a similar estimate was given by elman memmedov the mayor of hojali an even higher one was printed in the baku newspaper ordu in may NUM dead people named and more than NUM bodies reported unidentified this figure of nearly NUM dead is quoted as official by leila yunusova the new spokeswoman of the azeri ministry of defence francois zen ruffinen head of delegation of

estimate of the number of dead in the massacre don't get worked up it will take several months to get a final figure the 43yearold lawyer said at his small office mr rasulov knows about these things it took him two years to reach a firm conclusion that NUM people were killed and NUM wounded when soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist uprising in baku in january NUM those nationalists the

exposure in the highland snows killed the last three thirtythree people showed signs of deliberate mutilation including ears noses breasts or penises cut off and eyes gouged out according to professor

of NUM azeri militiamen are dead here six policemen there and in handwriting of a mosque attendant the names of NUM corpses brought to be washed in just one day the most heartbreaking account from NUM

pilot people waved up to us for help we saw three dead children and one twoyearold alive by one dead woman the live one was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up we tried to land but armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to return there has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few months and the

make it until at about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two armenian villages of nakhchivanik and saderak none of my group was hurt up to then then we were spotted by a car on the road and the armenian outposts started opening fire mr sadikov said azeri militiamen fighting their way out of hojali rushed forward to force open a corridor for the civilians but their efforts were mostly in vain mr sadikov said only NUM people from his group of NUM made it through including his wife and militiaman son seven of his immediate relations died including his 67yearold elder brother i only had time to reach down and cover his face with his hat he said pulling his own big flat turkish cap over his eyes we have never got any of the bodies back the first groups were lucky to have the benefit

NUM issue of the newspaper deutsche allgemeine zeitung since all the moslems capable of bearing arms were in the turkish army it was easy to organize a terrible massacre by the armenians against defenseless people because the armenians were not only attacking the sides and rear of the eastern army paralyzed at the front by the russians but were attacking the moslem folk in the region as well

tartars were for the most part poor some of them lived in villages and cultivated small farms many of them continued in the way of life of their nomadic forefathers they drove their flocks and herds from valley to valley from plain to mountain and from mountain to plain following the pasturage as it changed with the seasons they ranged from the salt desert shores of the caspian sea far into the mighty caucasus mountains even the village tartars are a primitive people only semicivilized i can see now that we armenians frankly despised the tartars and while holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country regarded and treated them as inferiors the fact that the russians looked down upon all armenians in much the same way as armenians regarded tartars far from proving a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors intensified an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility p NUM second paragraph our men armed themselves gathered together and advanced on the tartar section of the village there were no lights in the houses and the doors were barred for the tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great fear our men hammered on the doors but got no response whereupon they smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last tartar was slain throughout the hideous night i cowered at home in terror unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and the loud shouts of our men by morning the work was finished p NUM second paragraph as things were the members of the dashnack party were without administrative experience consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself incompetent to rule by legitimate means the members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and outside the law when they became a legally instituted recognized governing body with the destiny of armenia in their hands they proved incompetent to do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their fight against the russian and turkish governments in their outlaw days the outstanding feature of their rule now that they were in power was as in the old days trial and execution without hearing a man evoking the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him the method of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the condemned man in his home or on the street place a pistol to the back of his head and blow out his brains this simple way of getting rid of those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became a common way of paying debts p NUM first paragraph a soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the tartar i saw the point of the weapon emerge through his back another soldier seized a rock and pounded the tartar's head with it the armenian who had bayoneted him sprang to his feet wrested the weapon from the tartar's body and raising it to his lips licked it clean of blood exclaiming in russian 'slodkey slodkey' sweet p NUM second paragraph one evening i passed through what had been a tartar village among the ruins a fire was burning i went to the fire and saw seated about it a group of soldiers among them were two tartar girls mere children the girls were crouched on the ground crying softly with suppressed sobs lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and other furnishings of tartar peasant homes there were also bodies of the dead p NUM first paragraph i was soon asleep in the night i was awakened by the persistent crying of a child i arose and went to investigate a full moon enabled me to make my way about and revealed to me all the wreck

corner of the yard i found a women dead her throat had been cut lying on her breast was a small child a girl about a year old p NUM slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow the cart jolting and the loads swaying boys ran along the line of oxen encouraging them with shrill tartar cries and belaboring the beasts with sticks in the carts the women veiled as is the tartar way held children in their arms wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they sought protection from the wind and cold a few old men plodded along on foot across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown the leading oxteam reached this barrier and halted the gunmen and other ruffians concealed among the rocks opened fire women and children leaped and scrambled from the carts screamed ran and sought vainly for safety this massacre was not complete the armenian soldiers in the nearby barracks hearing the firing and the turmoil hurried to the scene that same day the abandoned tartar quarter of alexandropol was looted and completely destroyed p NUM great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hidingplaces on the retreat of the turks followed our army as

their hands and exchanging blow for blow they had died as the helpless must with their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself p NUM first paragraph in this movement we took with us three thousand turkish soldiers who had been captured by the russians and left on our hands when the russians abandoned the struggle during our retreat to karaklis two thousand of these poor devils were cruelly put to death i was sickened by the brutality displayed but could not make any effective protest some mercifully were shot many of them were burned to death the method employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut and then after crowding the hut with turks set fire to the straw p NUM first paragraph the tartar section of the town no longer existed except as a pile of ruins it had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered the same fate befell the tartar section of khankandi p NUM second paragraph many of our men had served in the russian army and were trained soldiers we armenians were rich and possessed arms tartars had never received military training they were poor and possessed few arms beyond knives shortly after the killing of the tartars in our village the revolution in russia was suppressed p NUM third paragraph within a few years following the beginning of the movement an invisible government of armenians by armenians had been established

because you don't agree with them hmm no because a fact and an opinion are two different things what you are expressing here are opinions not facts in the abstract what you're saying is true but the facts happen to agree with me and disagree completely with you i could give you hundreds of words in my mother tongue spanish that are comonly use and you will never find in a dictionary even more i could show you a lot of meanings that words in spanish have different from those in the dictionary we're talking about the latter not the former and what you're talking about is slang in the latter that clearly has never been the case here no i am not talking about slang i am talking about different uses of the same language in different places listen pinkas i'm going to count on the supposition that you think through the opinions you have something which is by the way against my better judgment based on what i've seen from you to date we are agreed aren't we that dictionaries are reference books for the usage of a given language and in particular for the meanings of the words and phrases which comprise that language now you are using meanings completely different from indeed in some cases diametrically different from those given in the dictionary as a reference book a dictionary contains those meanings in both past and as much as it can in current use that's also why they are updated so often now if you are saying things which you give different meanings than the dictionary does and using nonstandard meanings about every word what is your chance of being taken at face value just about none just about no one will take you that way because the words mean something different to them it's quite clear to me from the response this thread has been getting that that is exactly what is happening ponder that and guess why isn't it curious that we do not know how many people define in how many different ways the term jew which is the basis of the movement itself no probably because the question hasn't been asked gee i hate it when people draw conclusions without information don't you i hate people who cannot read i did not draw any conclusion i just said that it is curious considering how heterogeneous the movement is what you did was ask a leading question in english idiom the phrase and guess why in the way you used it is a loaded question with only one answer expected i also take offense at being told i cannot read by someone who is obviously having trouble with the subject himself mr pinkas i am a phd candidate in my field one does not get to phd candidacy if one cannot read the law of return and jewish nationality is defined in terms of religion and not of cultural identity even if NUM of those defined as jews in isreal are not religious for the umpteenth time it is not defined in terms of religion this has been proven to you over and over again no it has not the law of return defines a jew as someone who has a jewish mother and has not converted to another religion that is pretty the same as the religious definition that is a problem i am saying that i do not support zionism as it is now i believe that among the people in the soviet communist party some might even had been inspired by noble ideals does that change the final results of what happened in the ussr are you now wishing to compare the ussr and israel or what israel does not practice cruelty now i understand you are unable to make abstractions you cannot get the idea from a text and you take everything literally bad thing balderdash you know this is false i would be able to make the abstraction if it bore any resemblance to the facts of the matter yours did not the analogy is utterly inapplicable i wouldn't be in the field i'm in astrophysics if i couldn't make abstractions and speculate about the general grand scheme of things i also wouldn't be in education which i am and my students give me rather good reviews i'd add if i couldn't draw such analogies about israel not practicing cruelty ask those palestinians in israeli prisons those who were tortured those whose houses had been blown by the army the vast majority of palestinians in israeli prisons aren't tortured and their houses weren't blown up by the army in fact you've seen me protesting such measures on this net before are you now trying to intimate my agreement with them i never said it directly nor indirectly i am not talking about individuals who defined themselves as zionists here i am sure most of them are good honest and caring people i am talking about the results of the zionist movement in other words you are taking that as a monolith and ignoring the dissension within it disagreement that is expressed freely and is widely based just as bad can you read or are you just typing at random do you know the meanings of the words you use or do you expect the reader to read your mind i can read just fine thank you and i don't need someone who is obviously having some troubles with a tongue which isn't his native one telling me how to read the words in my own native tongue if it were spanish i'd ask you i am talking about a movement whose actions resulted in a law of return with a religious definition of jew a country that defines nationality based on religion then you're not talking about the movement as it exists today as i've been trying to tell you please read the arguments i've given you if you can still say this after reading them you need to read them again i am talking about something i consider a form of racism such as differenciation based on religious belief after all if arabs in israel cannot serve in the army is becasue they were not born in the right religion arabs in israel not only can but do serve in the idf as you well know they can serve it is true but they are not allowed to do the all the same things as the israeli citizens who happen to be jews yes they are as you well know ok fine now we know what you're talking about but do you see my point about how your words could easily have been taken differently it is not we it was you as in the second person in singular who cannot understand a text if things are not explicitly said balderdash see above once again you have a lot of gall and absolutely no right to lecture a native speaker of a language who is well educated in it in a language which isn't your own native tongue and with which you're obviously having problems so there is no difference between citizenship and nationality in israel or what do you mean by actually it doesn't i mean exactly that arab and jewish citizens of israel have the same rights if there is no difference between them why keeping them in id's better yet are you going to tell me that there are no differences in social life between arabs and jews social life is one thing legal status is another once again this is a leading question so it follows a religious definition and not a cultural one that is what i call a form of racism no because the jewish religion and culture are intimately inseparably intertwined if one renounces judaism one renounces judaism i do not believe that this is true final question is it possible

while others vote for parties that do not pass the minimum cutoff i worked within the labor party during the late 70's elections not this last one as a volunteer and was privy to the voting results that were returned from the local delegates elected at the time the system was structured differently but it did not cease to amaze me that there was no massive effort to lobby for arab reps by their

reassuring me in the face of NUM years of discriminatory practise quite simply if all eligible arab voters became members of the labor party and voted they would be able to command more than NUM of

heeding too much to the rightwing and ultraorthodox coalition members from the other front july NUM NUM translation of ha'aretz article racism in the knesset this attitude which until recently had not even aroused criticism being so natural and so deeplyembossed upon people's hearts holds that there are knesset members who despite having been elected by tens of thousands of votes are not entitled to be full partners in the body which represents the people of israel we are not speaking here of political discrimination which would be bad enough in itself but of racial discrimination the proof one of the compromises proposed was that mk mahamid an arab yigal should be replaced by tamar gojanski a jew yigal from the same party it was not the member's party which was considered unfit but his race fair enough my take on the matter and i will admit to the possibility that this might be seen differently is that this was a dummy argument if he was sitting on the committee then someone else obviously would not be in drumming up support for his seat mk would not be averse to using this argument or it could be used on his behalf as to the proof presented in this article i would find it very interesting to know who proposed the compromise along with a followup describing how the matter standswas resolved let me just take this opportunity to say that i deplore such actions and groundless justifications a test of selfconfidence by gid'on levi ha'aretz july NUM NUM but not to worry even now the jewish mind is contriving devices the new committee chair roni milo has already announced that he will set up subcommittees aplenty for his committee thus he will decide where it is permissible for mahamid to participate and where not a solution such as this could by the way also have been adopted for the rest of the committees thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secrets being leaked to the enemy and removing the stain of discrimination from the knesset for the record roni milo is a brash mk self described from the likud note not labor quite frankly i don't think anything he would say could surprise me annoy and aggravate yes surprise no do you accept that as documentation yes i do and thank you for providing it i would be most interested in knowing how things turned out anyone shai guday stealth bombers os software engineer thinking machines corp the

don't have a place to call our own i had a two bedroom apartment in sumgait my children went to school and we lived well in friendship it's painful that in our times in NUM in the soviet period people can break into our apartment and try to kill me and my children in whom i've put all my efforts and my whole youth everything was going well for us my older daughter was studying at the institute the middle one was preparing to enter medical school and was interning as an orderly and my youngest had been sick for a long time but had returned to health i have been though a lot in my life it's been seven years since i lost my husband i raised my children by myself lots of women have similar fates but there's nothing to be done about it but i can't control myself when i remember what happened in sumgait on february NUM NUM and NUM it was just a horror it's indescribable on february NUM our relative ira came to visit us she's better friends with my oldest daughter and so right away she asked where's vika i say vika's off in pirkuli on a trip for three days she's supposed to come back tomorrow my middle daughter gaya had baked a cake and we sat there talking and laughing drinking tea then gaya and diana went to walk ira home they left and a few minutes went by suddenly i hear noise i raced out to the balconyour balcony is right across from the bus station we live at the corner of mir and druzhba streetsi look and see that there are hoards of people near the bus station and they're all shouting something what they're shouting i can't understand our neighbor is standing on his balcony too i ask nufar what's happened he says i don't know i can't figure it out either i got scaredthe kids had gone outside and i wanted to run after them but then there was a knock at the door i open the door and it's the kids mamma says gayane you'll never believe what's going on out there it's awful ira says aunt zina they're shouting 'karabagh karabagh karabagh is ours' we didn't know what was going on they're threatening to drive out the armenians and slaughter them i called my brother and his wife answered the phone i said aunt tamara don't worry ira is staying here with us and we'll see her home later i couldn't shut my eyes all night long even until morning i was worried about vika my god what was going on what had happened gayane that day on the 27th we stood on the balcony and observed what was happening although mamma wouldn't allow us to watch all of it there weren't NUM yards between our building and the bus station we could see and hear everything perfectly they were stopping buses dragging people out leading all the passengers out looking for armenians if they found an armenian on the bus then it started i don't know what to call it zinaida it's called slaughter gayane the mob would descend on people and beat them i don't know if they were killing them or not but when they left them they lay still not moving as though nothing was left of them one person was lying there and they started dragging him the police were standing right there to the side not doing anything they didn't take any steps to calm that mob it was awful to stand there and watch it all from the balcony and you couldn't go anywhere somehow you wanted to be able to see everything so as to tell of it later we wanted to leave sumgait that day what kept us was the idea that we live in the soviet union and that something would be done about it where in the world was our government zinaida we couldn't leave town of course because our older daughter wasn't home and at the same time i was terrified for gaya and diana on sunday morning when i went to see ira home our neighbor said zin' you know they went into valodya's house and smashed everything he had they murdered his father and two sons valodya is our neighbor he's an armenian he lives on the first floor i think my god what is happening and in broad daylight i saw ira home and when on the way back i came across a mob shouting slay the armenians karabagh is ours this was at NUM o'clock in the afternoon on the way i stopped into a bread store and the saleswoman says they beat our store manager they thought he was an armenian and they beat him but he was an azerbaijani and i asked did they kill him she says no he's in serious condition i left there and started to walk home on that same street but the mob started moving in my direction i turned off the street and went down the little way that goes toward the sputnik store there i met another crowd but these weren't bandits these were our people from sumgait i was so frightened that i walked without knowing where was going i couldn't feel my legs or the ground under my feet i was walking and there was a boy standing before my eyes this was on the 27th around evening time he ran under our balcony and the mob surged toward him shouting he's an armenian get him he wore a black coat they grabbed him that boy near the bus stop i saw it they grabbed him by the legs and struck his head on the asphalt i made it home but i just couldn't calm down my oldest daughter was in my thoughts i was thinking my daughter's coming home now they'll stop her bus and she'll be gone there's no police no protection nothing it's like they had all died there's no one nothing no authorities whatsoever i can't even find the words for it i look and see an ikarus arriving before going to the bus station they stop near our place across from the kosmos movie theater so this ikarus stops there and the gang is yelling the azerbaijanis are running toward it yelling armenians out and i see them take the armenians and beat them killing them i can't watch it any more it was a nightmare i just couldn't watch it but gaya was standing there watching it and i scolded her she says mamma i have to see it i have to know what's happening i have to see it with my own eyes so i can tell our people of it later so our children will know gayane we saw a great deal on the 27th they caught no less than NUM people before my eyes i can't say for sure if they killed them or not zinaida there were too many people there the mob was too big you couldn't make anything out but i saw that boy in the black coat with my own eyes he was NUM or NUM years old gayane i think he was older probably about NUM a tall fellow a big guy in a coat he was walking quickly but when they shouted that he was an armenian he tore off running and the mob went after him they caught him right under our balcony i don't know i don't think there could have been much left of him after that you can imagine what happens when a crowd attacks one person it was a mob big angry and featureless you know there was a similarity in the way they were dressed mostly they were wearing long black coats you couldn't even tell them apart they were all wearing black and they all looked alike zinaida when they picked up that boy and struck him against the asphalt and he cried mamma i ran into the room i couldn't watch any longer an awful lot was going on right then in various places it wasn't only that boy several people were being beaten up you couldn't see all of it at once but when that boy cried mamma i immediately started watching only him gayane on that first day it went on from about six in the morning until twelve at night at midnight they dispersed and the police took their place they were scattered about in all districts but how can you explain the fact that by morning when it had already started getting light around seven o'clock our police were gone the police disappeared and yielded their positions to the bandits in the morning they started gathering at our inter section again at the bus station and at the entrance to downtown from morning on all the roads and mass transit stops were covered and by nine o'clock you couldn't even see the ground there were thousands of people in the crowd again they began stopping vehicles and checking for armenians zinaida they had signals i realized that when i noticed that they made a cross with their arms they crossed their arms over their heads the cross evidently meant that the vehicle had armenians in it they let the azerbaijani cars through and they stopped the armenian ones and started their pogrom gayane they stopped a white zhiguli and asked the driver what his nationality was he got out and said they were from baku but what is your nationality he says armenian they immediately start shouting ermeni ermeni and he says what's going on i'm coming from baku i don't live in sumgait doesn't matter who cares if you're from baku or sumgait anyway the crowd pounced on him and started beating him and they dragged a womanhis wife probablyout of the car at this point the police came and took the two and led them away then the mob started smashing the car and then burned it the flames blazed it was a horrible fire then everyone ran away they thought the car was going to explode about NUM minutes later another car comes along a green moskvich they ran up shouting ermeni ermeni but this time they didn't pull the people out of the car they didn't beat them maybe they burned them along with the car because no one emerged from the flames the neighbor boy vakhit was standing on the balcony too acquaintances of his walked by below and he asked them and they said yes they burned them along with the car about two hours later a whole wedding procession came by and there was a doll on the first car we thought they were armenians but the cars started to honk loudly they were azerbaijanis and they were immediately allowed through zinaida the driver waved his hand as if to say 'get out of the way' the whole crowd parted and the procession passed through freely gayane by the way at the marriage hall which is right in the courtyard of our building there was a wedding that day the azerbaijanis were cele brating and dancing on the streets there was grief and death people were being killed and people were celebrating the whole time zinaida before the apartment itself was attacked i asked gaya to call and find out when the tourist bus was supposed to arrive she went to her girlfriend's in the building she lives in the first entryway on the third floor gaya came back and said mamma the bus is supposed to come around eight after eight you can imagine what i was feeling how hard it was vika knew nothing about what was happening and was coming to meet her death then i heard shouting i raced to the window and see that the belongings of our neighbors from the second entryway are being thrown outdoors they were thrashing about with the pillows and the feathers were lying like snow i started to cry i am walking around the room crying wailing vika's not here what will come of her gaya of course was consoling me mamma nothing will happen to her don't worry calm down she's in good company they'll look out for her diana i saw the green car burn the car was burning when we went out onto the balcony gaya pushed me away telling me to get off the balcony i left then they came up to the balcony and asked if there were any armenians here zinaida you're right i forgot about that that was on the 27th diana there's a small grassy area in front of our balcony there are trees planted there the mob asked if there were any armenians in the building all the neighbors said no there are no armenians here there weren't a lot of armenians in our building but there weren't just a few armenian families either gayane they fell upon the apartments on the 28th there were terribly many of them our courtyard is huge and it was completely filled with them zinaida katusev had made an appearance on television earlier he said that two people azerbaijanis had been killed in karabagh and when he said that you know how bees sound have you heard how they buzz it was like the buzzing of millions of bees and with this buzzing they flew into our courtyard howling and shouting i don't know how to describe it by this point we were afraid to watch from the balcony but when i looked out of the bedroom windowthe znaniye bookstore is down there and armenians live on the second and fourth floorsi saw their things being thrown out the windows i realized that they would be upon us any minute i shouted to gayane gaya hide the gold that's honestly what i told my child i grabbed diana i didn't know what to do vika still wasn't home and it was already getting dark i was afraid to look at the time because i was already horrified as it was gayane just in case we changed the television channel from the moscow station to the azerbaijani one zinaida and turned it up loud gayane we never listened to azerbaijani music it just didn't do much for us in all those years we almost never listened to it but sometimes we would watch some entertainment show or film on azerbaijani television and that was it and here we had it turned up full blast so they would think we were azerbaijanis zinaida well you can imagine they're slaughtering armenians robbing them and we're listening to this concert music from baku our azerbaijani neighbors suggested we do it they knocked on the door and told gaya to turn on azerbaijani music but we already had it on anyway turn on the lights they told us so they will think you're not armenians they're saying the armenians are afraid to turn on their lights they're hiding gayane apparently there was some kind of arrangement because we noticed that the lights were off only in armenian apartments that is the azerbaijanis were warned and every last one of them had their lights on when we turned the lights off two of our neighbors came immediately and later another one turn on the lights they told us please nothing will happen be calm nothing will happen zinaida we won't allow them to come into your apartment gayane we believed those people we had never done anything bad to them zinaida after the whole nightmare about march NUM before we left for armenia when i was coming into the building they were all crying the azerbaijanis were crying saying can it be there is no god how could they raise their hands against your family you never did anyone any harm you never refused anyone anything not in hard times or in time of fortune or in time of mourning how could they give you away how could they sell you down the river they really had given us away some of them protected us but others gave us away they sold us down the river gayane i was wearing slacks that day and when it all began i became cautious for some reason and i changed my clothes azerbaijani women don't wear pants young armenian and russian girls in sumgait wore pants but the azerbaijanis found that very strange and i thought i better put on a skirt otherwise they won't believe me if i told them we were azerbaijanis there was nothing else we could do no other way out i was forced to turn myself into god knows who i let my hair down tousled it and threw a scarf over my head zinaida and she told me mamma you hide take diana and go into the other room you two look more like armenians they'll figure out that we're armenians right away but how could i go away and leave her there gayane i went out onto the balcony it worked out better that way we were the only armenian family in the fourth entryway this gave us hope we were the only ones the neighbors wouldn't let them in they the azerbaijanis would fear for themselves and for their children i looked and saw someone crawling up on the balcony from below it was easy to get up onto our balcony when we would lose the keys the neighbors would let up into their places and we would crawl across onto our balcony and get in that way so i turned around and saw a guy with a knife on our balcony he looks at me and shouts what nationality are you here zinaida at the same time they were knocking on the door gayane what nationality are you he's shouting well at first i was frightened but then i got control of myself and answered in perfect azerbaijani you should be ashamed of yourself asking a question like that can't you see i'm an azerbaijani if i were an armenian would i come out to meet you face to face and look you in the eyes he looks at me and tells the people with him yes azerbaijanis live here from below they tell him check it out it can't be they have to be armenians and he asks me again what nationality are you i say can't you see i started fuming i could not say anything else you're blind that's for sure you can yell all you want but that won't make us armenians i hear them breaking down our door and mamma went toward the door i say i don't have time to deal with you they're breaking down our door NUM go to the door and ask who is it they answer open up i say wait why are you breaking the door what's going on i'm opening up we never locked the lower lock it was broken but now they had locked it out of fear and i couldn't get it open i say wait i'm looking for the key i opened the doorit was almost broken down already i opened the door and they burst in i say what's going on why are you breaking down our door zinaida then they started climbing in from the balcony they're shouting why don't you open the door and i say well you've already come in the balcony then diana sees their knives runs into the bathroom and closes the door gaya cries out mamma diana ran into the bathroom i ran to the door and forgot that we were pretending to be azerbaijanis and said in armenian diana open the door gaya tried to calm them down and i'm shouting with tears in my eyes for diana to open the door diana i was sitting on the couch with my doll little red riding hood that guy climbed in from the balcony with a big knife with a yellow handle they put it up to mamma's stomach i ran to the bathroom opened the door and slammed it behind me i was frightened and started to cry i shouted mamma they want to kill you and then then they started shouting give us your passports and gaya says what do you need passports for we're azerbaijanis gayane i tried to convince them that we were azerbaijanis i was trying everything i could i could get on my knees and plead i could humble myself because at that moment i was worried about other lives than just my own to be honest i didn't care about anything else as long as my little sister would survive her life and health had cost us so dearly i tell them what don't you understand anything they started shouting they were tremendously excited shouting with terribly loud voices saying that in stepanakert their girls were being killed raped and tossed around with pitchforks why shouldn't they do the same to us i said who's doing all that who is doing it some armenians what does that have to do with us give me the knife i'll cut my own face now you calm down they tell me zinaida i told them why didn't you deal with them there there in karabakh nothing has happened here no one has been fighting here not we with the armenians nor they with us why didn't you give it right back to them there what've we got to do with this i got confused i had been saying that we were azerbaijanis but suddenly i started speaking as though i were an armenian but they didn't notice one of them was next to me with a knife at my breast and he says to the others what pretty girls he meant gaya and my 10yearold diana i was terrified gaya started assuring them that we were azerbaijanis one guy stood in the doorway and gave us bad looks gayane he demanded the passports i said young man i don't have my passport here he says let's have the passport we won't believe you without your passport and one of them started hurriedly searching for documents they turned the wardrobe in the other room upside down took the picture off the wall and started pulling the clothes off their hooks yelling and shouting passport passport they all started yelling there was so much noise in the apartment they were all shouting my hair stood on end suddenly i said listen my papa died NUM days haven't passed yet we have a muslim household we're in mourning you should be ashamed of yourselves you've disgraced your honor and then mamma started to cry zinaida i started crying my husband died NUM days haven't yet passed aren't you ashamed of yourselves in fact my husband had died seven years earlier in NUM we're in mourning and you burst in here demanding docu ments the documents are at the housing office i'm filing for my pension well it seemed like they believed us then one guy said they're lezgins can't you see there are no men here only women leave another fellow in the group agreed with him he also said that we were lezgins but a third said no they're armenians well the other two convinced him i don t know how and all the rest of them listened to them too there were about NUM of them if not more all in our threeroom apartment even the entryway was filled they started leaving yes we're lezgins we're lezgins they started leaving and one of them took our tape recorder with him and the one who had first called us lezgins says leave that what are you doing they seemed to obey that guy gayane he was tall wearing baggy jeans and a coat zinaida with a little moustache i think gayane no he didn't have a moustache he was tall with brown hair he wasn't a badlooking sort he didn't have anything in his hands zinaida he stood at the threshold gayane yes he didn't look like a bad guy and you know his face seemed familiar to me i had seen him somewhere and more than once but i can't remember where when he came in i was stupefied i had a premonition that he wouldn't be able to remain indifferent when he said that we were lezgins and that they should leave such gladness started to glow inside of me hope they continued to argue on their way out some said they're armenians all the same and that fellow answered even if they are armenians it's shameful the father died they're mourning there's nothing but women in the house there's no men we should stay out of the apartment what do you mean stay out we can go in there and he said no we should stay out they're lezgins we're leaving here the three of them protected us zinaida no the two of them the one in the short coat and the one in the grey suit who stood at the threshold about NUM or NUM years old well they were all young really the two of them defended us diana three three zinaida do you remember the third one diana diana yes he was wearing dark clothes gayane the third one was the one who came back he wore a long brown coat diana he wore a long darkish brown coat and his hair was dark too when they left they told him downstairs that those women were armenians and ran back and said that they were going to kill us zinaida they had all left and we had started to calm down a little and i closed the door and then there is a knock i told gaya take diana and go into the other room my daughters went into the dining room and i opened the door there was a guy there who said run hide they're coming to kill you now we ran up to the third floor we had some good neighbors up there azerbaijanis i sent the kids and stood there alone not knowing what to do i was so far gone out of a whole room i couldn't even think of anything to take i even forgot to take my work documents at the time i had been preparing a report to send to baku and the documents were at home i couldn't see anything i could only see vika my older daughter i sent gaya and diana upstairs and stood there asking that fellow should i close the door and leave everything like this he says what do you mean door get out of here they're coming to kill you what are you standing there for and i ran after the children gayane we barely had time to get up to the third floor when they burst into our apartment and started shouting where are the armenians we were already at the neighbors' they had an infant at the time and the neighbor said don't you worry i'm not letting anyone in this apartment no matter what zinaida on the third floor there i started asking the folks our neighbors to go meet vika the bus was due to arrive at eight o'clock i dissolved in tears gaya was soothing me diana was next to us she was crying too and i'm already thinking that i've lost my older daughter but deep in my heart i still believe she's alive and my tears choked me i was going out of my mind but no one could leave the building the courtyard was packed with people swarming with them from the balcony the neighbor in whose apartment we were hiding asked the bandits where are those armenians the ones who were at home where did they make off to they told him they didn't know they asked him where he lived he answered can't you see on the third floor he asked them specially to divert attention from his own apartment we heard them taking free reign of our apartment and they threw our color television off the balcony and it exploded gayane mamma was crying the whole time she fell into a faint and we brought her around and held her back because the whole time she kept making for the door to go outside alternately raving and sobbing shouting and calling vika she didn't notice us probably because we were next to her her thoughts were only on vika the neighbors who were hiding us were calming her too offering tea zinaida we are very grateful to them thanks to them my children and i are alive well and unharmed when they were throwing our belongings out and burning themthe beds the pillows and the chairsour neighbor came to us and said how lucky you are that it's not you standing there naked but some other woman instead you're from our part of the building you lost your husband you have children thank god you're not in her position we wouldn't have been able to take it i don't know what i would do he of course wouldn't have done anything he was just trying to calm us down in the yard they were torturing our neighbors fellow armenians they lived on the fifth floor in the third entryway a married couple vanya and nina and their three children their last name is v they hid their two daughters and stayed with their son to defend themselves they even got boiling water ready and an axe and held them off for a long time but the they beat up the husband dragged the wife outside and stood her naked next to our burning things her husband was lying at her feet on the ground the crowd shouted look at the naked armenian they were going to throw the poor woman into the fire the neighbors came out an azerbaijani woman threw her a scarf and she covered herself with it and the neighbors led her off to their apartment all the neighbors saw and heard it gayane mamma wouldn't allow it but i went to the window and saw her standing there and they took skewers that had been heated in the fire and stuck them into her body our neighbor who lived in the same entryway as ninashe lives with us in the same boarding house nowsaw what they had done nina showed her from her knees up almost up to her neck her whole body was covered riddled with wounds zinaida in the morning during the night of the 29th rather after one o'clock two buses approached the station i wanted to run out by then i didn't care any more if i lived or died but gayane wouldn't let me go and the neighbors said that i would bring disaster to them and they would be slain along with their children gaya was crying and said that i forgot about them my other children but i could only think of vika i imagined her torn to pieces i'm a mother and they're just children they don't understand i would have jumped off the balcony and run to the soldiers for help i was going to do it but gayane wouldn't let me mamma please mamma i beg of you the neighbors were sleeping and gayane woke them with her cries so we held on that way till morning on the morning of the 29th i told our neighbor i was going to go downstairs to our apartment maybe vika was lying there murdered he told me he would go himself he was gone for about five minutes but it seemed like an eternity to me he returned and said there was no one there nothing i went down too stole down like a mouse and slipped in everything was thrown all about i didn't go to the soldiers because the armored personnel carriers were far away farther than the bus station i began looking for the briefcase with my work in it i was miserable because of my daughter and at the same time because of my work my documents were there my travel papersi worked in the transport division and my trip sheets gayane mamma is a very responsible person she was always ready to work around the clock to do her job zinaida i look around and i can't find the briefcase i didn't care about the fact that everything had been stolen out of all three of my rooms that everything was smashed and the furniture was broken i worried about that later but at first i was concerned about the lost documents i went into the kitchen my daughter had hidden some valuables in the gas stove my ring and my earrings it was all there five minutes passed and gayane ran in and said mamma hurry and diana came downstairs too gayane found her coat among the debris and diana found her track shoes her coat and some of her dresses diana immediately after we got back up to the neighbors they started throwing things around in the apartment under us they threw a television onto the asphalt it exploded so violently it sounded like a thunderclap then when vika wasn't there i wouldn't eat and they forced me but i couldn't eat because i loved vika terribly and she and i had always gone to the movies and gone for walks in the park when we went into our apartment the next day and everything was broken right away i started looking for my dolls and my books but i didn't see anything when we went back upstairs i managed to take two cups from my tea service and gaya took vika's suit and one of her own dresses my italian boots were gone my brown coat it was beautiful there wasn't a one of my beautiful dolls and my giant lion was gone too the one that had been on top of the television he was very large and very handsome i had two satchels one for first grade and the other for second grade one was yellowgreen with a boy and a girl on it they're playing a drum and a violin and there is a dog sitting there closing its ears and on the other one were the letters a b c d e and the numbers NUM two girls and a boy with their mouths open like they are singing they were beautiful satchels they were gone too i had many books i collected them they were in the bedside tables and a boy had given me a little apron and a headband for my birthday they weren't around either and i had some big books fat ones and they disappeared only one was left the malachite box the adventures of karlson pippi longstockings and fairy tales of the world were left all the other books were gone zinaida i continued searching for my briefcase and then my supervisor arrived he had waited for me until nine o'clock but i didn't appear and he thought something must have happened so he came he's a russian aleksei semyonovich lomakin alik aliyev the mechanic came with him when they saw my wrecked apartment they were just petrified they could not say a thing when i saw them i started crying my azerbaijani neighbors came in some of them were crying others were helping me pick up i go on looking for my documents and at the same time put things into the wardrobe now that i remember it it's both funny and painful how could i have thought that i had returned to my apartment and that everything had gone back to normal incidentally later when i went back to the apartment again those things were gone too and the door was gone after my supervisor left in the afternoon the neighbor said that we should leave find another refuge i'm afraid he said that someone saw you come to my apartment and that they could kill you and us too my god where could i go it was daytime and those i don't even know what to call them the bandits those marauders those jackals i don't know what to call them i can't find the words they were everywhere where should i go with two girls when i opened the door i had tears in my eyes and i was terrified and he said go to alik's he's an azerbaijani too and i say you should have said that earlier when my supervisor was here with the car he could have taken us with him everyone feared for their own lives what could i do i went out into the entryway and stood and he says any other time i would keep you here a year or two but right now i'm sorry then another door opened also on the third floor i ask the neighbor tayara can we hide at your place she's an azerbaijani too she says what kind of question is that come in she hid us there were many people in the courtyard and gaya and i hid in the wardrobe and they put diana under a mattress leaving a small opening so the child could breathe tayara said that when the bandits left she would let us out and when they came back she would hide us again we sat in the wardrobe for about a half hour gaya became ill and i allowed her to get out my legs fell asleep and felt like cannons we hadn't eaten or drunk anything for so long since the 27th when we saw that horrorand all of it just snapped in me tayara's husband went outside even though i begged him to stay saying there should be a man in the house he said that he'd be in the courtyard and if anything happened his wife would signal him she put her passport and all of their documents on the table so if they suddenly came in she could show them that they were an azerbaijani family my girls went to the windowand what was going on out there i feared for my children that someone would recognize them from the street gaya let her hair down and put on a scarf so she would resemble an azerbaijani but directly across there was a 9story building their windows were right across from us and i shouted that someone would see her and give us away on the spot but she kept on looking diana i watched too zinaida downstairs the bandits were fighting with the soldiers the soldiers didn't shoot they didn't have orders to i saw them throwing rocks at the soldiers they were young boys NUM and 19year olds and they defended themselves i'm a mother after all and they were no different from my children when one of the soldiers fell and his head started bleeding i had to stop looking l couldn't watch anymore i imagined my children in their shoes gayane the troops had assumed their defense that morning and had cordoned off the buildings and some of the soldiers surrounded the bus station block NUM and our microdistrict NUM but they only cordoned them off from the outside the mob fell upon the soldiers who started to protect themselves and the mob surged into the courtyard with the soldiers after it they caught several azerbaijanis and started beating them with their clubs one fell down and they cracked open another's head zinaida they show lebanon on television and the war in afghanistanthat's just what it was like like in america how they attack demonstrations with shields and clubsthat's just how it was in our courtyard gayane don't compare it with america those were peaceful demonstrations but these zinaida but how could it happen here and not off somewhere in america they attacked the soldiers hurled stones at them then i thought where's the tear gas that the americans use to disperse demonstrators if they had used gas on those jackals they all would have scattered gayane they would not have scattered the soldiers had been there since morning they didn't bring in fresh troops they hadn't eaten they were fine standing there for about three hours but then they got tired they weren't even allowed to sit down at noon they the soldiers attacked them and then the tables were turned the mob went after the soldiers the guys were bunched into a group in the center street and covered themselves with their shields and the azerbaijanis surrounded them and threw paving stones at them and those guys sat there covering themselves with their shields and meanwhile tanks with machine guns were cruising the streets they always say our children have never seen war i never even dreamed about it there was no need to but then i thought about those people who had lived through a war it was truly horrible the guys were tired exhausted some had had their clubs taken away others their shields they had been beaten they were covered in blood so many died they beat the soldiers with their own clubs and shields and those guys stood there and couldn't defend themselves they couldn't open fire they couldn't even defend themselves let alone us it's comical zinaida what are you saying how can it be funny gayane no i didn't mean that how could something like that happen during our soviet period it's painfully embarrassing and they burned the armored personnel carriers too someone shouted get away it's going to blow everyone scattered away and the armored personnel carrier exploded the soldiers lost their senses and when they drove the personnel carrier and the bus at the mob out of rage and fury they drove right up on the sidewalk zinaida the bus that had brought the troops only the driver was in it the bus ran over three people straight off i saw it and two armored personnel carriers ran over four more all in one or two minutes the bus ran over three one of the carriers ran over two and the second two more right on our street there's a dry cleaners and appliance and watch repair places one of the armored personnel carriers went that way and they say it ran over several over there too but they ran over seven before our eyes then the bus ploughed into a book kiosk gayane no that was a flower place it was a new booth he drove straight into it zinaida the driver jumped out and they dragged the vehicle out to the middle of the road and set it on fire gayane and i also saw the troops put a bunch of azerbaijanis in a bus and take them in a convoy to baku there were many arrests zinaida our neighbor the one who hid us couldn't take it and he told his wife that we should leave they were running around in the courtyard looking for the armenians they knew that they were hiding with azerbaijanis and they were saying that they were going to check the azerbaijani families poor tayara got scared too and started to cry i pleaded with her i said that i would remember forever how she saved my children and me but where could we go gayane she didn't make us leave she said that she would do anything but she was afraid zinaida i told tayara that we would just stay a little longer and that at night we would return to our apartment then her husband came back and said that a curfew had been imposed he says zina you owe us a drink gorbachev announced a curfew and bagirov first secretary of the communist party of azerbaijan ssr was on television he said that two people had been killed in karabagh but nothing was wrong automobile windows had been broken but there hadn't been any killings he kept making statements and there were azerbaijani songs and dances tayara turned the tv all the way up when we learned of the curfew we calmed down but then a crowd ran into the courtyard again a large one our neighbor told them that there had been only one armenian family here but they had already killed them all there was no one left we hid in the wardrobe again and they stuck diana back under the bed gayane tayara went down to our apartment to see what was happened there and found two bandits they asked her what are you doing here tayara answered i came to take something for myself take all you want they're gone now zinaida yes she had wanted to get something for us at least some bedding she said what are you going to do empty handed naked with three children nothing remains of your entire apartment in short we calmed down and the crowd raced off to the other building the one across from us i don't know what went on there gayane the curfew had its effect on the gangs many started to disperse they were warned that they would open fire on them the soldiers didn't know the city they couldn't get oriented they drove up and down the main streets but didn't go into the courtyards when we were at the city party committee they asked people from sumgait to go with them and show them the way zinaida the tanks entered the city on the night of the 29th gayane no mamma the tanks had been there earlier but were near the city party committee where the armenians were after midnight on march NUM when i had finally gotten to sleep after two sleepless nights mamma said get your things together they have sent buses for us as it was we had been dressed the entire time mamma went to check it out and came back for us zinaida when i came back for the children tayara said that vika was alive and well some guys had come and told her that they had hidden her in a safe place i both believed it and didn't believe it we ran out to the tanks the gambarians were there roman and sasha their father shurik the clarinetist was killed and their mother was there sasha came over and asked about the girls i was surprised how did he know my girls he said that he knew me and the girls our neighbor himself went for gaya and diana and it seemed like he was taking forever so i went after him another neighbor came out anna vasilyevna a russian zinochka my dear goodbye and good luck she kissed diana they put us in the bus and the captain gave the order for us to be taken to the city party committee the bus wouldn't start so they put us on another one it was pouring rain diana when they imposed the curfew there were many soldiers on the streets and they all had clubs and shields and when the azerbaijanis attacked them many of the soldiers died they threw paving stoneshuge rocksat the soldiers i saw this myself the soldiers ran over those azerbaijanis with the tanks the soldiers saw that the azerbaijanis were doing violence to people and they ran over them out of rage we got scared and they hid me under a mattress and a blanket and gaya and mamma crawled into the wardrobe and they were fighting right down there on the street near the building they were blowing up buses and tanks and cars were burning and there were many dead in the courtyard they drove without looking to see if it was a sidewalk or a street they just drove and the ones who didn't manage to get out of the way were run over by the tanks and when we leftit was evening it was already darkthere were three buses and one of them had soldiers in it mamma ran up and said get your clothes on let's go gaya was wearing slippers and i had on my blue dress but it was an old one i was wearing my old jacket my old dress and slippers and nothing else gaya had on a skirt her angora sweater and slippers it was raining hard and there were puddles on the street they gave mamma an old coat because she was wearing a shortsleeved dress she put it on and we ran out we got onto the bus and i was hungry one of the soldiers from yerevan gave me rations and carried me from one bus to the other in his arms i gave him the little glass that remained from vika's trousseau and he gave me his telephone number gayane in the bus there was a soldier with a shield sitting at every window we had to be ready for anything they took us to the city party committee let us out and then took us into the city party committee building under armed guard it was jammed with people and you couldn't breathe we asked are these all us armenians they answered yes we were surprised that there were so many armenians in sumgait all those years we lived there and didn't know there were so many armenians NUM we were struck by that we had never noticed going downstairs the next day i ran into the secretary of the komsomol from vika's plant the khimprom he said that vika was alive and well when i told mamma she of course calmed down some more but you know after all that it was hard to believe anything our faith in everything was just gone she didn't believe it completely zinaida i didn't believe it because i had heard all kinds of things when we arrived at the city party committee we heard everything imaginable it was the fear of god i saw many of our acquaintances they were kissing each other and asking how their children and homes were many people already knew that there had been a pogrom of our apartment they had seen the broken windows i cried saying that i didn't know where vika was one woman said that they had taken two of her daughters and that she couldn't find one of them the other had been slashed all over a second said that her husband and her son had been murdered that was nelli aramian she lived in building NUM in our microdistrict they killed her husband armo and her son artur i heard so many things like that that i was already starting to lose touch my patience had run dry waiting for my daughter later an azerbaijani fellow came to me and said aunt zina vika sent me she's alive and well and hidden in a safe place if you want i'll call her there and you can speak with her we went downstairs to the first floor and he called vika i spoke with her heard the voice of my child she had managed to survive in that hell then i started begging that azerbaijani to bring her to the city party committee he tried to talk me out of it i'll bring her wherever you go don't worry i've looked after her better than a brother does a sister all the same i asked him to get her he brought her and i calmed down on the second day there was a meeting with demichev member of the politburo of the central committee of the communist party of the ussr and people started shouting one shouted give me my son back another yelled where is my daughter a third wanted her husband bagirov was there too and he stood there blinking not saying anything gayane when demichev asked where we wanted to go everyone shouted to russia to be honest we were all frightened of armenia there were such wild rumors it was as though we were in a terrible dream and no one wanted to go to armenia but he said that he couldn't evacuate NUM people to russia and that he would meet with everyone individually the next day and speak with them and he also said that today he was going to go look at all of our apartments on march NUM we went to the military barracks in the village of nasosny we were taken care of marvelously by the military they sent special flights of children right from there to minvody yerevan and moscow one woman left for moscow with a letter for gorbachev and gromyko zinaida the worst was truly behind us by then everything had passed but the pain will remain for our whole lives it cannot be forgotten under no circumstances should we our children or our grandchildren forget who will answer for those who died for our mothers sisters brother sons and daughters who will bear the responsibility who will wash away their blood someone should be made to answer and severely so it has an effect on the people that did with us as they pleased it isn't over yet now we live here in armenia protected but the issue isn't resolved we would like to stay in armenia in our homeland so that all the armenian people will be united then we will be invincible armenians won't be scattered throughout the soviet union about the world and if we're all together this won't happen again as a mother of three children as a woman as a sister i ask armenians to be united so that what happened in sumgait will never happen again our homeland the only request we have is that we be helped in obtaining an apartment and getting jobs so that our children can work for the good of armenia if we aren't able to then let our children do it and if it's possible we'll work for the good of armenia too this is the land of our forefathers our grandfathers and greatgrandfathers lived here too it was only later that people dispersed all over like a mother the land here bore and reared us it is our wife and will protect us too i want but one

convince anyone this is just usenet not the real world i just read the opinions others have about a subject and sometimes i present my opinion i think that this net is only useful to exchange ideas i never wanted nor i want now to convince anyone of anything fine now if your opinion isn't convincing anyone and it's getting refuted regularly by the facts which is the case isn't it likely that your opinions need some revision as i said i do not want to convice anyone so why should my opinions convince anyone i do not believe that my opinions are refuted by facts then you haven't been paying attention to the arguments levelled against them they have been over and over again they will be again first and i repeat it i never said that the idea of jews having the right to have a state is racist zionism as a movement is more than just that idea in a word utter and complete horse puckey look the term up in the dictionary maybe youy view of a dictionary is the problem here one thing is the accepted meaning of a word by a dictionary and sometimes a completely different thing is what that word came to mean after a long time hey what do you think dictionaries are for you quite obviously need one a good dictionary gives both and you well know it i think that zionism in the way it defines who is a jew for example is racistlike ok now how would you define it and by the way you're wrong again there is no uniformity of this definition among zionist movements you know this is the case it's been pointed out on the net directly to you before and yet you continue to maintain this delusion ok tell me how many people in zionist movements define a jew in a different way and how many are who define jew based on a religious way i don't think that data exist on this directly in the same way i believe that irish have a right to nationalism but i do not support the bombing and killing of the ira i believe that jews have a right to nationalism but i do not support zionism as it is right now comparing the actions of israel to that of the ira is like comparing those of the us to those of chile under pinochet for example with the ira in the role of pinochet you really need to get your history straight you also need a basic dictionary you need to start reading before answering my point was that because some movement claims to be nationalistic it does not mean that i consider it to be nationalistic i did not comapre israel to the ira i think that you are starting to put words on my mouth and that is wrong that is no problem but once again you are defining zionism as one movement you are implying that it is monolithic you know this is not and has never been the case stuff deleted by pinkas his statement which i was responding to with the below asserted that zionism was uniform and monolithic i never said that zionism is monolithic if you are going to attribute me things present the quotes where i said that you don't say it directly you implied it and i showed explicitly where and how you implied it now you're trying to wriggle out of it won't wash and you know it that is what makes the basis for zionist movements however i am not considering just that but the rest of it in a word i don't believe you your words tell a very different story especially since they are not based on fact but innuendo and misrepresentation that is your problem i could certainly interpret this like you are running out of arguments first you put words in my mouth now you say you do ot believe me it's you not me who is running out of arguments which makes an interesting point people living in a jewish state have shown that jewish culture includes in it jewish religion but they are not the same so the jewish people living in the jewish state have shown us that there are some problems in a state where NUM of the people is secular but judaism is define according to religious standards or where marriage is a religious stage or where the law of return defines a jew according to a religious standard no it doesn't nowhere does the law of return demand that one must be religious or even believe in gd to become a citizen of israel thereunder why don't you try reading for a change did i say that the law of return demand a person to be religious now how does the law of return define who is a jew and who is not i said that it uses a religious standard if your mother is a jew you are a jew if your mother is not jewish neither you are do not twist my words please what you said is that judaism is defined according to religious standards now this can have several different meanings and you know it one of the meanings that it can have is to say that only those who are religious are defined as jews another is to say that only those who meet the religious definition of a jew is one and there are others i'm not twisting your words i'm trying to make you aware that your words don't mean what you think they do true there are debates in israel and abroad about who is a jew but those debates are taken up by both religious and secular would you say that religious people should not have a say in that would you deny them their right of free speech i am not talking about the debate i am talking about how things are right now when the debate is over i'll see what happens right now things are like they are let me ask you one thing i understand that israel differenciates between citizenship and nationality suppose male and female have a child in israel which nationality will the child's id show according to each one of the following cases actually it doesn't and the citizens' rights are exactly the same in both cases anyway a f and m are both jewish jewish b f is jewsh and m is not jewish c f is muslim and m is jewish d f is christian and m is jewish it'll depend on what religion is practiced in the house the original law of return would still admit such a person if they were jewish if memory serves e f and m are both nonjewish not jewish did those israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become nonjews why should they still define then a jew based on what is a religious definition it's called history how do you think jews stuck together through pogroms for millenia in europe we had to know who was our own i for one do think that some change is in order and that patrilineal descent is no less legit than is matrilineal which is not the religious jew's point of view there's plenty of room for that in zionism as you well know it called history at some point it was ok now i believe it is not that's valid as far as i can see according to webster's ninth new collegiate dictionary merriamwebster inc publishers springfield massachusetts usa NUM page NUM hypocrisy a feigning to be what one is nnot or to believe one does not so saying that one believes in zionism as a simple matter of people having the right to nationalism but disregarding the right of the palestinian people to do the same according to this dictionary is hypocrisy utter baloney by the way i do believe the palestinians have a right to selfdetermination have stated so on this net and i know you've seen it interesting how do you know had i ever talked to you about this and forgotten about that more than once as have others but that right to selfdetermination cannot be at israel's expense israel's security comes first and that security must be maintained you're also twisting words now beyond belief if you think that's what that definition means in this context you need a firstgrade course in english which definition are you now talking here about the very one you give above it is absolutely inconsistent with the twist you put on it i do not know why you are so touchy i never said that you did not support palestinian selfdetermination i just gave an example of hypocrisy no you didn't you had to twist the definition of the word NUM degrees in order to do so and everyone else knows it i'm not being touchy i never said that someone in this net is guilty of it it was just an example nothing more nothing less than that why did you have to clarify what you think because what you gave was not an example it was an example of how the definition of a word can be twisted around NUM degrees if you didn't use different meanings of words than are in the dictionary you might be believable here you have several problems first you should know that words have more meanings than those given in the dictionary oh so now what are dictionaries for second it may come to be a shock for you to know that there are more words than those in the dictionary duh as a scientist whose technical terms are very often not found in common dictionaries i know this but when a term is common like hypocrisy a good dictionary can be regarded as an authoritative source third we can exchange ideas if you want but you come out with this nonsense about being believable using the definitions given in a dictionary it's not nonsense when people read what you write they have to try to associate a meaning to those words dictionaries give the meanings of words don't they now i assume that you'd like to have the words you use mean what you'd like them to but the fact is you're using very different meanings than are in the dictionary or you would like the reader to assign them new meanings which they never had it seems that you cannot answer to the ideas given by others without insulting others sad not at all what i cannot abide is utter bombast when you've been proven completely wrong if your facts at all resembled even the slightest bit of truth which they do not you might be believable if you did not put words in my mouth it might be that you might start reading what i had actually said i never put even one syllable in your mouth you have tried to prove this and you failed so far you come over and over twisting what i said or presenting things i never said as if i had said them poppycock in this way you are answering to yourself that is why you do not find it believable maybe if you start reading what i had actually said and not what you added you might change your mind i read what you said i did not add anything you simply either don't know that the words don't mean what you'd like them to which cannot be the case now since you've been proven wrong and you quite obviously don't have a defense against the arguments presented or you're twisting the meanings which is it but the fact is that there is nothing resembling fact in what you've said on this thread and the fact also is that you're using different definitions for your words based on baloney than anyone else does first there is nothing resembling a fact in what you added to what i said as if i had said it ha there's

reason was mainly economic that is to capture booty in order to maintain the bases which we had then established with very poor resources the main idea despite this remained the conquest of the village by force of arms something which was then unknown in the country and became a turning point in jewish military operations yehuda lapidot jabontinsky archives testimony apart from the military discussion the lehi put forward a proposal to liqui date the residents of the village after the conquest in order to show the arabs what happens when the izl and the lehi set out together on an operation and for another main reason it would cause a great uproar throughout the land and would be an important turning point in the course of the battles the clear aim was to break the arab morale and raise somewhat the morale of the jewish commu nity in jerusalem which had been hit hard time after time especially recenctly by the desecration of jewish bodies which fell into arab hands yehuda

killed my uncle ali hassan zeidan and my aunt fatima she heard him call 'help me' she ran to him and they killed her another neighbour haj yarah heard some voices and came out they killed him too his

was yet another example of the american and european media playing into the hands of iraq and its de facto allies the destruction of the iraqi convoy at mutla' was portrayed as an allout slaughter this is simply not true the head and tail of the convoy was bombed initially resulting in a lot of casualties at these points before bombers came back most of the rest of the iraqi soldiers fled on foot furthermore your estimates of kuwaiti war dead if allies hadn't invaded is completely ridiculous you have acknowledged certainly implicitly that saddam is a barbarous brute you have acknowledged the hundreds of thousands he has been responible for killing in his own country you know that the man he appointed as governor of kuwait ali majid was his most brutal henchman presiding over the near genocide of the kurds in the late 80's and more recently the shi'a yet when it comes to his treatment of kuwaitis he is an angel in your estimate he would've killed fewer than he already had when the war started what a joke apn NUM NUM iraq war dead copyright NUM the associated press all rights reserved by nick ludington associated press writer washington ap after the persian gulf war ended the world was told that as many as NUM iraqi soldiers were killed at one point even baghdad put the toll that high as did the us defense intelligence agency in private but us officials have been backpedaling ever since even though the pentagon has yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public now one former dia analyst says the number of iraqi troops killed may have been as low as NUM that conclusion by john heidenrich writing in the current issue of the quarterly magazine foreign policy represents the lowest estimate yet from us defense sources the revisions suggesting a less devastating iraqi toll fit a pattern of vastly moderated us military claims in the months after the war ended claims for a number of us weapons also were scaled down despite the dramatic videotapes of successful weaponry or the shocking pictures of iraq's disastrous retreat from kuwait arguments have continued unabated about what really happened in the gulf war heidenrich is not the first to question the iraqi death toll numbers that originally were aired more that a year ago air force lt gen charles horner the commander of the air campaign in the gulf war said he believed the iraqi military death toll was fewer than NUM for the entire war the pentagon itself still refuses to provide an estimate of the number of iraqis who died in the 42day war against the usled coalition in january and february NUM on monday pentagon spokesman lt cmdr joe gradisher reiterated past statements that there just isn't a number that is credible but some current internal estimates range from NUM to NUM iraqi troops killed said one analyst speaking on condition of anonymity who is familiar with the pentagon's reports allied deaths were put at NUM americans NUM by friendly fire NUM british NUM by american fire NUM frenchmen NUM italian and NUM among various arab allies of the postwar reassessments the most widely publicized was the army's reluctant acknowledgement months later that its touted patriot air defense system was nowhere near so effective as claimed against iraq's scud missiles the bush administration initially claimed an almost perfect record for the patriot last spring it revised the hit ratio to NUM percent the success record of the navy's tomahawk hightech cruise missile used against targets in baghdad and other parts of iraq also turned out to be more modest than initially indicated by the pentagon the first iraqi casualty figures to surface after the war came in a may NUM report by the environmental group greenpeace which said NUM to NUM iraqi soldiers were killed it estimated that NUM to NUM iraqi civilians were also killed the same month published reports said the defense intelligence agency estimated NUM iraqi soldiers were killed and NUM wounded in the air and ground campaigns although the agency qualified that by saying the estimate could be off by as much as NUM percent in either direction but as more information became available those figures gradually were revised downward the house armed services committee staff estimated NUM dead and NUM wounded after a review last year but heidenrich writing in the current issue of the quarterly foreign policy estimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensives as low as NUM with about NUM wounded heidenrich based the conclusion in his article on the number of bodies found and buried by us troops NUM and on prisoner of war interviews he noted that only about NUM of NUM iraqi prisoners of war were wounded based on the calculation that about half as many wounded escaped as were captured he put the number of wounded at about NUM using a conservative ratio of one dead to two wounded applicable to third world armies like iraq he set battlefield deaths at NUM maybe the figures are too low he wrote maybe the real death toll on the battlefield was NUM or NUM or even NUM even then the evidence suggests a death toll of well below NUM or even NUM in an interview he said the NUM figure was obviously off base because it would mean that virtually all the iraqi soldiers in the kuwait theater of operations were casualties he said today's bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology but rather the drawnout conflicts such as those in yugoslavia and somalia\",\n",

and iraq's recognition to the sovereignty and territory of kuwait'' compiled by firyal alshalalbi origins of kuwait the establishment of kuwait is attributed to barrak b ghurair of the bani khalid who used kuwait as a summer residence the beginning of kuwait goes back to the late 17th century and some historians go further up to NUM kuwait's name is derived from alkut which means fortress kuwait is also called qurain which is the diminutive of qarn a horn or hill kuwait town flourished and grew since its establishment the 'utub alsabah family is a branch of 'utub settled in kuwait during the early 18th century they lived under the protection of bani khalid until NUM after that they became independent and sabah bin jabir was chosen as the first ruler for 'utub carsten niebuhr NUM a dutch explorer was among the first who wrote about the arabia he was the mathematician in the scientific expedition sent in NUM by the king of denmark to arabia he documented details of arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the gulf and in the case of kuwait he was the first writer to give the two names by which the town was known kuwait and qurain niebuhr's chart of the persian gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that century see the map from abu hakima history of eastern arabia NUM pub1965 alsabah 'utub kept good relations with other powers in the eastern arabia according to

ottoman ruler in eastern arabia in fact ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged their attempts to restore their lost position in alhasa through the campaign of thuwayni in NUM and ali pasha's expedition against the wahhabis in NUM were unsuccessful at kuwait the nearest point of the utbi domains to the ottoman mutasallimiyya of basra the shaikh was under no form of ottoman control the aim of 'utbi external policy was to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the gulf'' p NUM abu hakima continued in his conclusions that kuwait was not a dependency of basra the persian occupation of basra NUM did not affect kuwait'' p183 kuwait had its own identity through the ottoman domination on the arab world this identity was clear to the british and the french who tried to win the support of kuwait's sheikh between NUM when the british wanted his support in their conflict with the french in the gulf area independent kuwait this is the first of a series of articles that testify to the independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the ottomans the following text is related to an expedition carried out by the ottomans in NUM against the wahhabis in eastern arabia where the oil fields in saudi arabia now kuwait and its ruler at that time sheikh abdulla ibn sabah ibn jabir allied themselves with the turks abdullah' role in the fighting was not a minor one he joined the expedition as a commander of the large kuwaiti fleet and was the first to use its guns against the besieged town of alqatif had it not been for this bombardment by the kuwaiti fleet alqatif obviously would not have surrendered in a mere three hours in relation to this a question arises as to why the ottoman warships refrained from participating in the bombardment the answer lies in reports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of the progress of the expedition because the ottomans were unwilling to jeopardize the maritime peace imposed by britain in the area the sultan and the pasha promised their warships would not be used in the war against su'ud or any sheikh in the war zone kuwait which was not a party to the abovementioned treaty of NUM was under no such obligation especially since the expedition was not directed against those who had signed it from the above text we can see that kuwait was not part of the ottomans or the british colonies for more details about the mentioned expedition please check out the source of the above text the modern history of kuwait NUM by ahmed abuhakima mcgill university canada independent kuwait2 this is another article of a series of articles that testify to the independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the ottomans the following text discusses a dispute on an estate called sufiyya in zubair iraq between the sheikh of kuwait and alzuhair tribe in zubair in NUM trouble developed over the possession by sheikh sabah of the estate which was purchased by his father sheikh jabir in NUM this property was sequestered by a turkish qa'immaqam representative on the basis of a claim by the alzuhair that the vendor had been the owner of a share and not of the n 100e sufiyya at the same time sheikh sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at the island of fao some cultivators who had immigrated from persian territory it should be recalled that the turkish officials from the start showed strong prejudice in favor of the zuhair claimants abdulla ibn sabah the eldest son of the ruler of kuwait who went to basra as his father's agent in the case narrowly escaped being thrown into jail upon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven years produce which the ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were entitled to receive eventually the dispute was settled by the wali governor of baghdad in favor of the sheikh of kuwait the decision of the governor of basra in favor of the sheikh was apparently made for various reasons some writers think that the governor wanted to win abdulla over to the turkish side and suggest that the governor namiq pasha even offered him the title of qa'immaqam which he declined nevertheless the proceedings of the turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants of kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with zubair it seems that they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the british agent at basra the people of kuwait were prepared to a man to abandon their town rather than submit to turkish rule lorimer suggests that the final order of namiq pasha upholding the kuwait sheikh's title to sufiyya was perhaps due to a report that sheikh sabah with the object of attacking zubair if the decision should go against him had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support from the wahhabi amir'' in addition to this legal matter with zubair kuwait had had other problems with basra whose courts tried to jail abdulla ibn sabah as explained above however kuwait's relations with the ottoman mutasallims of basra had at times been amicable and in several instances those mutasallims even sought refuge at kuwait when pressured by the pashas of baghdad who exercised control over them source the modern history of kuwait NUM by ahmed abuhakima mcgill university canada independent kuwait3 this is another article that testifies to the independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the ottomans when pelly colonel pelly the british resident in the gulf visited kuwait for the first time on march NUM NUM he was met at jahra by sheikh mubarak the second son of the ruler sheikh sabah just before he reached kuwait town on march NUM he was met by sheikh abdulla the eldest son and heir apparent who accompanied him to the town gate on their way to a very good home'' which had been prepared for pelly and his companions scarcely had we entered it'' says pelly when sheikh sabah himself came'' this description of pelly's reception indicates that to a certain degree it was run according to protocol the government system of kuwait and administration of justice were the subject of comments made by pelly the government is patriarchal'' says pelly the sheikh managing the political and the cazee qadi the judicial departments the sheikh himself would submit to the cazee's decision'' punishment was rarely inflicted indeed there seems little government interference anywhere and little need of an army'' pelly in admiration of how the sheikh ran the affairs of the country retold the following remark which the sheikh had made to him when my father was nearly NUM years old he called me and said i shall soon die i have made no fortune and can leave you no money but i have made many and true friends grapple them while other states around the gulf have fallen off from injustice or illgovernment mine has gone on flourishing hold to my policy and though you are surrounded by desert and pressed by a once hostile and still wandering set of tribes you will prosper'' source the modern history of kuwait NUM by ahmed abuhakima mcgill university canada independent kuwait4 this is another article that testifies to the independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the ottomans the british had always regarded sheikh jabir as a good friend'' but in october NUM an event took place at kuwait which could have weakened those good relations on october NUM lieutenant edmunds the assistant resident at abu shahr in iran arrived in kuwait on a special mission from the resident captain hennell his mission was to find out if kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a british line of post across the desert from kuwait to the mediterranean the british war vessel fired the usual salute in honor of the sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of kuwait bay the salute was not acknowledged and edmunds waited in the vessel for three days before he was able to communicate with the sheikh after edmunds' return to abu shahr both he and captain hennell explained this unusual behavior of the sheikh to have been due not to illwill but principally to a desire to mislead the egyptian agent at kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the british therefore they considered that jabir's conduct did not indicate any change in his friendly policies towards the british if the british tolerated the attitude of jabir towards edmunds so also did the egyptians earlier in the same year some of the most wanted men in the wahhabi camp such as 'umar ibn 'ufaisan the wahhabi general in alhasa and wahhabi tribes like alduwaish sought refuge in kuwait protection of refugees seeking political asylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by sheikh abdulla ibn sabah this can therefore be looked upon as an indication of selfconfidence an outcome of kuwait's independence from foreign powers it corroborates the fact that kuwait if necessary was prepared to defend itself against more powerful neighbors this defense depended not only on the walls of the city but also on bedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with the necessary guns comparable to other arab fleets of the time as to kuwait's position between NUM and NUM one can safely state that it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the struggling wahhabis and egyptians relations with the british and even with the pasha of baghdad continued on good terms source the modern history of kuwait NUM by ahmed abuhakima mcgill university canada they were trying to recover land they believed was theirs much like the argentines in the faulklands the kuwaitis pushed just a little too far by taking iraqi oil and saddam thought he'd settle the dispute the old

april NUM sold many of his adl files on antiapartheid activists to south african intelligence meanwhile between NUM and NUM the adl paid him nearly NUM using a prominent beverly hills attorney as a conduit in order to conceal its financial relationship with bullock last month police raided adl offices in los angeles and san francisco as well as bullock's home confiscating computer files and

wells fargo and eureka federal savings as well as itemized canceled checks with the names of the payees the dates and amounts bullock even knew the balance in the christic institute's checking account investigations by the fbi and police in san francisco have revealed that the adl has shared at least some of its spy gathering material with israeli government officials what's more israel apparently used tips from the adl to detain palestinian americans who travelled there the adl was established in new york city in NUM to defend jews and later other minority groups from discrimination it led the fight against racist and fascist groups like the ku klux klan and the american nazi party and in the 1960s championed the civil rights movement but there was also a darker side in the late 1940s the adl spied on leftists and communists and shared investigative files with the house committee on unamerican activities and the fbi the adl swung sharply to the right during the reagan administration becoming a bastion of neoconservatism to irwin suall a repentant trotskyite who heads the adl's powerful fact finding department the real danger to jews is posed not by the right but by a coalition of leftists blacks and arabs who in his view threaten the fabric of democracy in america as well as the state of israel in the tradition of his ideological soulmate william casey suall directed the adl's vast network of informants who were given code names like scumbag ironside and for a spy reportedly posing as a priest in atlanta flipper for years journalists and liberal members of the jewish community knew the adl spied on rightwing hate groups as long as the targets were antisemitic organizations like the liberty lobby and lyndon larouche no one seemed to be particularly troubled but the bullock case reveals that the adl also spied on groups that have a nonviolent and progressive orientation this apparent massive violation of civil liberties may end with the adl's criminal indictment in san francisco where the investigation began the human rights group faces possible criminal prosecution on as many as NUM felony counts including an indictment for gaining illegal access to police computers says one source close to the west coast investigation it is NUM per cent certain that the adl will be indicted in the wake of the san francisco investigation police probes of adl spying are spreading to other parts of the country we have received numerous complaints about adl spying says sam adams a spokesperson for the mayor's office in portland oregon on april NUM the harlembased black united fund of new york and african american selfhelp group that bullock allegedly spied on wrote district attorney robert morgenthau requesting an immediate investigation of the adl the adl's actions cause great concern as it is a direct and flagrant violation at minimum of our civil rightswe call upon you to join with the district attorney of san francisco tobring and end to this latest form of mccarthyism gerald mckelvey a spokesperson for morgenthau's office says we have no evidence before us that warrants any sort of investigation mckelvey adds that morgenthau offered to assist the fbi and the san francisco da's office on their pending investigation they have not so far asked for our assistance the adl acknowledges sharing information on violenceprone groups with law enforcement officials it also admits to maintaining extensive files on a wide variety of organizations but says in a twopage press release the vast majority of adl's files are composed of news clips magazine articles books journals and other documents adl has made it clear that it does not and will not countenance violations of the law on the part of anyone connected with the agency and the process by which the league gathers information is presently under review to insure that no laws are being violated that's what the adl says for public consumption but morale is so low that its employees complain of sleepless nights and crying fits and even as other jewish groups circle the wagons around the adl in a show of solidarity many do so holding their noses more than a few jewish officials privately say the adl has to decide whether it is a human rights group or a secret police agency the adl is regarded both inside the jewish community and outside the jewish community as the definitive source of information on anti semitism and extremist groups says daniel levitas the former executive director of the center for democratic renewal an atlanta based group that monitors antisemitism racism and hate groups one of the things this scandal has done is that it has completely tainted the adl's credibility and reputation with regard to its objectivity this scandal is going to be a devastating blow to the jewish community at large because people regard the adl as synonymous with american jewry bullock's talents as a snoop and his extreme conservatism meshed well with the adl's cold war worldview in NUM he moved to southern california where he became an adl spy for NUM a week bullock almost always used his real name when snooping although he once called himself elmer fink when corresponding with supporters of alabama governor george wallace bullock provided the adl's office in los angeles with written reports which were transmitted to fact finding department head irwin suall according to court records under suall's stewardship fact finding department had become the adl's heart and soul located at adl national headquarters across from the united nations the department had assembled a vast library on hate groups culling material from publications speeches and informants reports bullock was more than adept at leading a double life not long after moving to california he ingratiated himself with a woman in the john birch society who helped him gain access to the group's boston office there he found a file the rightwingers were keeping on the adl the discovery gave rise to speculation in the adl new york office that they had somehow been penetrated by the birchers bullock focused almost exclusively on rightwing extremist groups until the early 1970s when adl la head milton sinn was replaced by harvey schechter who encouraged him to target the left as well a few years later bullock moved to the castro district in san francisco where he posed as an art dealer and adl fact finder who had infiltrated the local arab community had just been exposed when the ensuing scandal died down bullock was ordered by the adl to penetrate the arabs the adl was especially concerned about the americanarab anti discrimination committee founded by the former south dakota senator james abourezk to combat arabbashing in a page out of the cia's dirty tricks handbook on penetration and destabilization bullock joined the adc and then recruited nazis into the group apparently trying to discredit it according to published reports in NUM the adl sent bullock to attend the national association of arab americans annual congress in washington according to court documents bullock was told to find the source of the group's funds bullock was unable to follow the money but he did such a good job at ingratiating himself that he was appointed to head a naaa delegation that visited congress member nancy pelosi it's not surprising that the adl penetrated arab organizations but only acute paranoia explains their interest in groups like act up as far as bullock was concerned gay groups in san francisco were heavily infiltrated by what he called gay left revolutionaries prompting him to write about their activities for the adl bullock soon expanded his horizons moving into the shadowy realm of foreign espionage after richard hirschhaut the head of adl's san francisco office introduced him to thomas gerard in NUM gerard was then a detective with the san francisco police department's intelligence unit gerard had worked as a demolitions expert for the cia in el salvador in the early 1980s where he apparently had more than a passing interest in rightwing death squads police searching gerard's briefcase found extensive cia literature about torture and interrogation photos of blindfolded and chained men as well as passports made out to gerard in NUM different names including thomas clouseau from a remote jungle island redoubt in the philippines where he fled last november gerard told the los angeles times that he will blow the lid off the cia's involvement with latin american death squads if he is indicted in the adl spy case after their very first encounter in the adl office gerard and bullock had lunch at mcdonald's i liked tom right off bullock later told a san francisco police investigator whose report of the interrogation was obtained by the voice tom is a very charming roguish character with a great deal of integrity let me say here i consider tom gerard one of the finest policemen i've ever worked with absolutely honest capable intelligent and NUM percent american before long bullock was providing gerard with confidential adl reports on various groups and individuals in turn gerard gave bullock classified police intelligence files on local arab americans skinheads and others bullock told the fbi that gerard's material ended up in his adl reports i would say NUM percent of the data that i got was name address and sometimes physical description criminal history very rarely bullock told investigators gerard also gave bullock a chart that outlined a vast network of bay area arab american businessmen and organizations that allegedly has ties to middle east terror groups as well as surveillance photos of arab americans receiving weapons training overseas bullock claims that us customs in new york gave gerard the photos it was understood that bullock would be very careful with what he did with the information gerard gave him and that bullock would not release it except to the adl or other law enforcement officers says an fbi report there was nothing unusual about bullock's cozy relationship with law enforcement by the mid1980s the adl was swapping files with hundreds of official friends the organization's euphemism for us law enforcement and intelligence sources the adl's relationship with the fbi's counterterrorism office was so close that adl's reports on arab american group's covert ties to middle east terrorists were must reading it's no accident that police found a NUM classified fbi report entitled popular front for the liberation of palestine pflpnew york area while searching the adl's san francisco office in NUM adl spooks investigated seven palestinians and a kenyan studying in california universities on student visas when the adl discovered they were disseminating pflp literature it informed the fbi which in turn took the case to the immigration and naturalization service after the ins ordered the students deported as subversives adl regional director david lehrer gloated in the los angeles times about his office's cooperation with law enforcement although he's backpedaling now the los angeles NUM deportation is still under appeal while the adl worked quietly with america's top cops it enjoyed similar ties with israel's spy agencies a charge that adl leaders vehemently deny but as early as july NUM NUM adl director benjamin epstein wrote to b'nai b'rith executive secretary saul joftes requesting NUM for his investigators our information he boasted to joftes in addition to being essential for our own operations has been of great value and service to both the united states department and the israeli government all data have been made available to both countries with full knowledge to each that we are the source in NUM the adl came under fbi scrutiny in the wake of the pollard spy scandal while assigned to the navy's antiterrorist alert center where he had access to the most closely guarded us secrets jonathan pollard stole thousands of pages of classified documents for israel which according to federal prosecutors could fill a room the size of a large closetten feet by six feet by six feet pollard's handler was avi sella an israeli air force colonel whose wife worked for the new york adl as a lawyer pollard later wrote to friends that a prominent adl leader was deeply involved in the israeli spy operation while there is no proof that anyone connected with the adl was involved with pollard there is evidence that the adl freely passes information to israeli intelligence in march NUM the fbi interrogated david gurvitz an adl fact finder in los angeles until NUM when he was fired by suall for illegally obtaining police information to use against a rival at the simon wiesenthal center the fbi pointedly asked gurvitz if he had ever transmitted information to israel gurvitz admitted that in NUM he had learned from a law enforcement contact that michael elias allegedly a member of a radical plo faction was scheduled to travel from san francisco international airport en route to haifa gurvitz phoned the deputy israeli consul general in la with the information later the same day according to a 15page fbi interview of gurvitz obtained by the voice gurvitz was called back by another man who said he was from the israeli consulate and who asked gurvitz to repeat the information about elias gurvitz did not get this man's name but their conversation was in hebrew so gurvitz felt confident the man was actually an israeli consulate official among the NUM names of private citizens that police found in adl files in san francisco was mohammed jarad a 36yearold chicago resident who was arrested in israel on january NUM for allegedly distributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to hamas the large islamic fundamentalist movement in the occupied territories the chicago adl office runs at least three undercover informants who work with official friends in local law enforcement according to documents released by the san francisco da and sources close to the adl given these facts arab american groups surmise that the adl has passed information on jarad to israeli intelligence one technique used by the adl to monitor the large arab american community in the midwest was to scan the local arab press for funeral notices according to sources familiar with the practice adl investigators in unmarked vans videotaped the palestinian funerals which sometimes turned into plo rallies palestinians have been detained at bengurion airport simply on the basis of having been filmed attending a funeral in chicago according to suhail miari the executive director of the united holy land fund whose cousin was an arab member of israel's knesset shortly after jarad was arrested the israeli government announced that hamas was being run from america with money and operational instructions relayed by courier or fax israel's charges were played up on the front page of the new york times according to well placed sources yehudit barsky an adl fact finder in new york worked closely with israeli officials on this campaign of vilification introducing friendly reporters to official friends in chicago law enforcement barsky who is fluent in arabic prepared an adl report about how hamas is funded in america she identified the dallasbased islamic association for palestine in north america as the front organization for hamas in the usa its infrastructure functions as an interlocking network of organizations small businesses and individual activists says the february NUM adl report which outlines the organization's development its activities on us college campuses and its metamorphosis during the gulf war it also traces hamas fundraising through a plethora of alleged front groups from plainfield indiana to culver city california it is doubtful that barsky could have compiled such sophisticated data without the help of official friends and adl spies barsky refused to comment but she used to talk to greg slabodkin as many as three times a week when he was an opposition researcher for aipac whose spy operation was disclosed last summer in the voice the level of cooperation was very close slabodkin said during a recent phone conservation from israel where he is in graduate school if we felt our files were lacking we contacted the adl when sha'wan jabarin a 30yearold palestinian human rights worker in the occupied territories won a NUM reebok human rights award in NUM slabodkin recalls that barsky faxed aipac the man's entire police file which she had obtained from the israeli embassy jabarin had been arrested numerous times in israel and once confessed to being a member of the plo after having been severely tortured jabarin who received a short jail term became an amnesty international prisoner of conscience of course to aipac and the adl jabarin was a terrorist slabodkin who was ordered to keep tabs on him when he was in the us to receive his award called a representative of al haq the palestinian human rights group that employed jabarin to obtain his itinerary aipac even opened a file on musician jackson browne who presented jabarin with the reebok award while the adl may be able to rationalize its close monitoring of arabs and even leftwing gay revolutionaries it has a far harder time explaining its obsession with spying on antiapartheid activists david gurvitz told the fbi that when he started working as a fact finder for the adl in la in march NUM adl files already bulged with information about the israelsouth african connection and anti apartheid groups gurvitz confirmed that the adl did routinely collect information on persons engaged in antiapartheid activities in the united states says the fbi report while gurvitz said there were files in the la adl office dating to the 1930s he estimated the oldest material on antiapartheid activities dates back to the late 1970s paralleling begin's rise to power in israel and a deepening of ties between the jewish state and south africa in about august NUM says the report of the fbi's march NUM NUM interview with gurvitz an antiapartheid demonstration was held at the south african consulate in los angeles participating in the demonstration were the los angeles student coalition and the socialist workers party gurvitz went to two demonstration planning sessions and a subsequent demonstration he wrote a report for the adl on each of the planning sessions and on the demonstration copies of the reports were disseminated to bullock among others in care of the san francisco adl office in NUM bullock learned that the consul general of the south african consulate in los angeles would be speaking in las vegas at a meeting organized by willis carto the head of the antisemitic liberty lobby suspecting that the consul general did not know who willis carto is says the fbi report bullock suggested to gerard that they might want to warn the south africans gerard agreed and informed the consul general who canceled his appearance a few months later gerard phoned bullock and told him a south african intelligence officer wanted to meet them during a rendezvous in a hotel near fisherman's wharf the south african said he was interested in acquiring information on american antiapartheid activists the south african who called himself mr humphries also asked for information about groups that were advocating divestments gerard who was present throughout the meeting says the fbi report told humphries that he gerard had been employed by the ciahumphries offered to pay bullock NUM per month in exchange for information bullock noted that much of the information humphries said he wanted was already in the possession of bullock and the adl between NUM and NUM bullock sold information to south african intelligence receiving steady raises which he split evenly with gerard bullock said it was his impression though gerard never explicitly told him so and bullock never asked that gerard may have been telling the cia about his and bullock's contacts with the south africans says the fbi report gerard had said he knew the cia 'resident agent' in san franciscoonce after gerard dropped bullock off at bullock's residence following a meeting with louie who replaced humphries as their handler gerard said he was going to go to the san francisco cia office al the while gerard may have been tasking bullock for the cia bullock recalled that once after he had met gerard bullock went to chicago illinois to conduct an investigation on behalf of the adl says the fbi report the target of the investigation was a group called the palestine human rights campaign bullock learned that a woman name deleted was transporting money between the plo or the pflp and the united states bullock told this to gerard gerard later told bullock that gerard's 'guy at the cia' would like to know more gerard asked bullock if bullock would go back to chicago to gather more information on the palestine human rights campaign bullock however never did go back gerard also seems to have had a close relationship with mossad which may have started in NUM when he went on an adl junket to israel the adl frequently sponsors trips for american law enforcement officials to israel where they are wined and dined and meet their counterparts in various intelligence agencies according to an affidavit by san francisco police inspector roth the allexpense paid trip to israel was more or less a thankyou gift and a liaison gesture by the adl to continue the close relationships it has with specific law enforcement officers from the united states gerard may have liked what he saw in israel a short time after travelling there he went to addis ababa where he helped with mossad's rescue of ethiopian jews as gerard's relationship with south africa deepened he talked more openly about his exploits in the cia bullock recalled gerard mentioning that he had been in algeria on cia business and that gerard discussed the plo and 'safehouses' says the fbi report to this louie once responded that israeli intelligence had determined that the plo and the african national congress were cooperating gerard also spoke of having travelled with the cia to afghanistan louie also told gerard and bullock about his adventures inside south africa as an intelligence officer both gerard and louie traded 'war stories' and regaled each other and bullock with tales of 'narrow scrapes' although there is still much mystery about what triggered law enforcement's investigation of the adl it was probably the theft of a classified fbi report on the nation of islam from the fbi's san francisco office police armed with search warrants recovered the report in the adl san francisco office gurvitz says he had sent a copy of it to mira boland the director of the adl's fact finding division in washington dc boland was preparing an oped piece for the washington times in which she argued that the nation of islam should not receive federal funds for the reconstruction of la because the group is antisemitic and violenceprone boland who had arranged the adl police junket to israel attended by gerard testified in a NUM criminal trial in roanoke virginia that she had worked for the cia for NUM months and later was a subcontractor for the defense department before joining the adl during the trial boland admitted to sharing information with a cia official at an invitation only adl conference after he was questioned by the fbi last fall gerard fled to the philippines which has no extradition treaty with america gerard is believed to have supplied information from police computers not only to the adl but to israel and south africa as well the san francisco examiner reported that gerard may be charged with violating federal espionage laws although bullock worked for the adl for NUM years and irwin suall praised him in a july NUM memo as our number one investigator the adl now argues that he was a rogue agent in its own defense the adl also asserts that its fact finders operate no differently than journalists after all ask adl officials don't journalists keep files but the difference between the practice of journalism and the adl's method of gathering information couldn't be more striking journalists place information in the public domain where they are held accountable for falsehoods distortions and libel and for the most part journalists don't share their investigative files with foreign and domestic police agencies the adl has no such inhibition because many of its files are not open to public scrutiny false information collected by ideologically biased researchers cannot be corrected once a proud human rights group the adl has become the jewish thought police the adl says it's a human rights group not just for jews but for everyone says chip berlet a highly respected researcher at the massachusettsbased political research associates which monitors rightwing extremist groups that's fine but it can't do that and spy on palestinians it's blatantly unethical and frankly immoral my argument to people is that the adl wears four hats each of the hats independently is appropriate it is a broadbased human rights group that looks at the broad issues of prejudice and discrimination it is a group that defends jews against defamation entirely noble nothing wrong with that hat it is a group whose leaders at least consistently defend the actions of israel against its critics which again is entirely appropriate and it is a group that maintains an informationsharing arrangement with law enforcement again there is nothing wrong for a group to do that but you can't do all four it is impossible to do all four and not violate the bounds of ethics there's a builtin conflict of interest if you wear all four hats adl national director abraham foxman apparently sees no such conflict in a september NUM NUM letter to the voice foxman complained adl has a proud 80year record of fighting bigotry and promoting civil rights and constitutional freedoms any imputation of an effort or motive on our part to smear or stifle the free speech of anyone is false and baseless throughout his pieces on aipac's spying friedman describes the dissemination of information as if it were slander and the existence of files as a token of mccarthyite inclination the depiction is misleading in several ways virtually every journalist academic politician and organization keeps files on subjects they deem relevant tracing the logic of friedman's reckless charges the library of congress is tantamount to the kgb moreover disseminating the public record of a public figure is neither defamation nor mccarthyism but many believe the adl is increasingly in the defamation business ask jesse jackson james abourezk or the leaders of the new jewish agenda all past targets of adl smears at the same time the adl exonerated the fascist world anticommunist league which assisted ronald reagan's covert war against nicaragua a policy endorsed by adl leaders in the early 1980s researchers russ bellant and berlet asked to meet fact finding head irwin suall to discuss their work on antisemite lyndon larouche our view then of irwin suall was that he was this really terrific investigator says berlet so we introduce ourselves say what we are up to and suall leans back in his chair and basically runs down a dossier on each of us about what our political activities are who we work with what organizations we belong to obviously he was just trying to blow us away and he succeeds admirably we were just sitting there with our mouths open feeling very uncomfortable and then he leans forward and says 'the rightwing isn't the problem the leftwing is the problem the soviet union is the biggest problem in the world for jews it's the american left that is the biggest threat to american jews you're on the wrong track you're part of the problem' we were stunned i was virtually in tears this is not how i perceived myself we basically stumbled out of there in a daze letters response to friedman's article the village voice may NUM NUM vol xxxviii no NUM a league of his own robert i friedman's assault on the antidefamation league the anti defamation league is spying on you may NUM demonstrates that he has an axe to grind and his own prejudiced and biased agenda to promote it also demonstrates that concern for accurate reporting is far down on his list the story is replete with inaccuracies innuendos and outright falsehoods and conveys a picture of adl so divorced from reality as to be farcical friedman is even wrong on such basic easily determined facts as where adl was founded chicago not new york and the building in which adl's san francisco office is located not the jewish community federation building pictured adl has done the work of fighting haters for NUM years without spying on organizations or individuals and with profound respect for the law our mission is to monitor and expose those who are anti jewish racist antidemocratic and violenceprone and we monitor them primarily by reading publications and attending public meetings through the years we have published scores of reports on anti semitism emanating from both the left and the right in fact although friedman's bias leads him to assume the contrary adl's primary concern is still the far right because extremist organizations are highly secretive sometimes adl can learn of their activities only by using undercover sources friedman's hyperbole notwithstanding these sources function in a manner directly analogous to investigative journalists some have performed great service to the american people for example by uncovering the existence of rightwing extremist paramilitary training camps with no recognition and at considerable personal risk the information adl obtains is placed in the public domain and through the years adl has established a reputation for accurate reporting friedman's article by contrast contains so much misinformation that it would take an article equally as long to set the record straight a few examples he states that an adl leader was deeply involved in the jonathan pollard israeli spy operation and that pollard's handler's wife worked for the new york adl as a lawyer not true friedman also states adl investigators in unmarked vans videotaped palestinian funerals not true elsewhere he asserts that adl was obsessed with spying on antiapartheid activists again not true we could go on and on and of course friedman does not reveal his sources the distortion games friedman plays when he mentions numbers further reveal his lack of objectivity when it comes to how much adl paid roy bullock a week as an independent contractor not an employee an important distinction friedman also fails to make he includes the zeros NUM NUM inviting the reader to see a large number by contrast when he observes that adl paid bullock nearly NUM between NUM and NUM he chooses not to point out that amounts to little more than NUM a year hardly an excessive sum what is accurate about friedman's story is chip berlet's description of adl's four hats yes adl looks at broad issues of prejudice and discrimination yes adl defends israel against critics and yes adl maintains an informationsharing relationship with law enforcement regarding extremist activities and hate crimes we see no conflict in these four activities and we believe most voice readers won't either abraham foxman national director antidefamation league manhattan robert i friedman replies for the adl to compare itself to investigative journalists is absurd journalists don't spy on arabs and antiapartheid activists and then freely pass their files to south african and israeli intelligence but according to police the confessions of two paid adl investigators buttressed by NUM pages of court documents and interviews the adl does indeed the adl spies on groups that are neither antisemitic nor violent police confiscated adl files on hundreds of mainstream groups ranging from act up to peace now respected intellectuals and middle east scholars who disagree with the adl's political views have ended up on adl blacklists their reputations smeared private organizations have no business paying operatives inside police departments or having spies says an april NUM editorial in the st louis postdispatch condemning adl spying on april NUM police armed with search warrants raided adl offices in san francisco and la after concluding that adl employees were apparently less than truthful in voluntarily turning over documents during an earlier search according to san francisco police inspector ron roth's sworn affidavit roth also asserts that bullock was a paid employee for the adl if so by failing to pay taxes on NUM of income paid to bullock the adl could face a total of NUM felony counts according to court papers the adl may also face felony charges for illegally obtaining confidential information from police computers as for errors the adl was founded in chicago and moved to new york in NUM but it was an original tenant in the san francisco building shown in the voice photo moving out a few months ago i never wrote that an adl leader was deeply involved in the pollard israeli spy operation i reported that pollard himself made the charge and in court papers pollard's own lawyer said that the wife of pollard's handler worked for the adl if i have a bias it is

their culture to the point where they only see the absolute negatives of that culture generally or regarding a particular event and accept only those views purely opposing aspects of that culture thus selective belief inuse of historical facts and a complete ignoring of context results hate their culture i believe that things are getting mixed here critizicing israel andor being antizionist is not seeing the absolute negatives of that culture if that culture referred to is israeli being antizionist can be seen as a complete denial of that entity's right to exist and its legitimacy just as saying that islam has no right to establish and implement a state that includes any nonmuslims both are absolute onedimensional views of that culture with regard to the issue of state maybe because a person can see the positives of that culture is that that person opposes zionism and the actions of the state of israel if that were the case one would expect a few of that culture's positives to be discussed with regard to the issue at hand since the issue centers on israeli culture i have yet to hear of any positives of that culture in this discussion i for one consider the actions of the state of israel with respect to the human rights of the palestinian people as an example of an action thaty opposes what jewish culture was suppose to uphold as an example of respect and what the jewish people learned about oppresion segregation and years in the diaspora i agree with you but i also feel that when a culture feels it is confronted by another group that wishes to see that culture disassembled the first culture has little choice but to try to secure its survival as well as maintain its moral center since the culture is not about to turn away from either the matter of its survival or the valuing of its moral principles it has the virtually impossible job of balancing to discuss israel's faults and crimes without any recognition of this circumstance and reality it faces is a conscious decision based on the discussant's political biases not on an honest and empathetically open understanding of the situation the same applies to those who attempt to paint the palestinian movement as all bad and dispense with considerations of the reality facing them that certainly describes elias since he has no intention of recognizing that alongside the palestinian experience and perspective there exists also that of israelis he might not want to recognize that it does not make him a selfhating jew as far as i see it at most he is a person who is not telling the truth you beg the question by centering on the symptoms while the issue of selfhating addresses the motivations i certainly feel that anyone who expends so much effort inflating distorting and robbing human context from aspects of hisher own culture is reflecting a degree of dislike for it since bits of that culture are bound due to hisher upbringing to be a part of himher a bit of self dislike seems likely to be mixed in somewhere who is a jew a person whose integrity decays when unmoved by the knowledge of wrong done to other people a j heschel that is why i get moved when i see the israeli army killing people in the occupied territories as much as i get moved when i see a plestinian stabing people in israel and this is precisely why israeli society has been tremendously harmed by the actions it its government has felt it had to take in response to an other perceived as a threat just as with you there has long been a strident and emotional debate about the pain israelis feel when forced to balance desires for survival and moral beliefs the trauma of having to make that choice is made worse by the fact that neither can be conveniently brushed aside as a result of a reasoned political debate for the sake of the other only reshaped but so far it seems that the blame is always put on the other if you read this newsgroup for example israel is never guilty by herself she is always responding to the actions of the other and it goes as if the actions of isreal do not also affect the response of the other' in a cycle that never ends also there is blindness to try to understand what the other feels and why as you well know this process of blaming the other for the morally questionable actions one side is forced by the other of course to take is thoroughly practiced by both sides if you are only hearing the proisraeli crowd's selfsupporting arguments that may be due to the fact that you are not listening for anything else i certainly hear the similarly distorting propalestinianproarab element in this newsgroup as well as in socculturearabic there is always and excuse there is always a rationale to explain why things happen as they do and what is the worst part for me there seems to be all the time an intention to try to dehumanize the other as if the other did not care about their future children peace etc etc aap i agree agree agree agree however in my response to the initial discussion above between davidsson and those opposing his presentations i saw davidsson carefully putting academic frills around a blatantly onesided series of ihatedislike them yesidoyesidoyesido i did not find the approach of those opposing davidsson to be centered at all on a denigration and denial of the other side i certainly do wonder if the degree to which davidsson's views on the middle east have distorted is connected to his dislike and rejection of his jewish lineage having said this however i agree with you that this constant accusing others of being selfhating jews seems pointless it is not worse a label than is why you're on their side except to perhaps imply a certain degree of overly enthusiastic biasedness tim tim clock phdgraduate

just read the opinions others have about a subject and sometimes i present my opinion i think that this net is only useful to exchange ideas i never wanted nor i want now to convince anyone of anything fine now if your opinion isn't convincing anyone and it's getting refuted regularly by the facts which is the case isn't it likely that your opinions need some revision as i said i do not want to convice anyone so why should my opinions convince anyone i do not believe that my opinions are refuted by facts first and i repeat it i never said that the idea of jews having the right to have a state is racist zionism as a movement is more than just that idea in a word utter and complete horse puckey look the term up in the dictionary maybe youy view of a dictionary is the problem here one thing is the accepted meaning of a word by a dictionary and sometimes a completely different thing is what that word came to mean after a long time i think that zionism in the way it defines who is a jew for example is racistlike ok now how would you define it and by the way you're wrong again there is no uniformity of this definition among zionist movements you know this is the case it's been pointed out on the net directly to you before and yet you continue to maintain this delusion ok tell me how many people in zionist movements define a jew in a different way and how many are who define jew based on a religious way in the same way i believe that irish have a right to nationalism but i do not support the bombing and killing of the ira i believe that jews have a right to nationalism but i do not support zionism as it is right now comparing the actions of israel to that of the ira is like comparing those of the us to those of chile under pinochet for example with the ira in the role of pinochet you really need to get your history straight you also need a basic dictionary you need to start reading before answering my point was that because some movement claims to be nationalistic it does not mean that i consider it to be nationalistic i did not comapre israel to the ira i think that you are starting to put words on my mouth and that is wrong stuff deleted by pinkas his statement which i was responding to with the below asserted that zionism was uniform and monolithic i never said that zionism is monolithic if you are going to attribute me things present the quotes where i said that that is what makes the basis for zionist movements however i am not considering just that but the rest of it in a word i don't believe you your words tell a very different story especially since they are not based on fact but innuendo and misrepresentation that is your problem i could certainly interpret this like you are running out of arguments first you put words in my mouth now you say you do ot believe me which makes an interesting point people living in a jewish state have shown that jewish culture includes in it jewish religion but they are not the same so the jewish people living in the jewish state have shown us that there are some problems in a state where NUM of the people is secular but judaism is define according to religious standards or where marriage is a religious stage or where the law of return defines a jew according to a religious standard no it doesn't nowhere does the law of return demand that one must be religious or even believe in gd to become a citizen of israel thereunder why don't you try reading for a change did i say that the law of return demand a person to be religious now how does the law of return define who is a jew and who is not i said that it uses a religious standard if your mother is a jew you are a jew if your mother is not jewish neither you are do not twist my words please true there are debates in israel and abroad about who is a jew but those debates are taken up by both religious and secular would you say that religious people should not have a say in that would you deny them their right of free speech i am not talking about the debate i am talking about how things are right now when the debate is over i'll see what happens right now things are like they are let me ask you one thing i understand that israel differenciates between citizenship and nationality suppose male and female have a child in israel which nationality will the child's id show according to each one of the following cases a f and m are both jewish b f is jewsh and m is not c f is muslim and m is jewish d f is christian and m is jewish e f and m are both nonjewish did those israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become nonjews why should they still define then a jew based on what is a religious definition it's called history how do you think jews stuck together through pogroms for millenia in europe we had to know who was our own i for one do think that some change is in order and that patrilineal descent is no less legit than is matrilineal which is not the religious jew's point of view there's plenty of room for that in zionism as you well know it called history at some point it was ok now i believe it is not according to webster's ninth new collegiate dictionary merriamwebster inc publishers springfield massachusetts usa NUM page NUM hypocrisy a feigning to be what one is nnot or to believe one does not so saying that one believes in zionism as a simple matter of people having the right to nationalism but disregarding the right of the palestinian people to do the same according to this dictionary is hypocrisy utter baloney by the way i do believe the palestinians have a right to selfdetermination have stated so on this net and i know you've seen it interesting how do you know had i ever talked to you about this and forgotten about that but that right to selfdetermination cannot be at israel's expense israel's security comes first and that security must be maintained you're also twisting words now beyond belief if you think that's what that definition means in this context you need a firstgrade course in english which definition are you now talking here about i do not know why you are so touchy i never said that you did not support palestinian selfdetermination i just gave an example of hypocrisy i never said that someone in this net is guilty of it it was just an example nothing more nothing less than that why did you have to clarify what you think if you didn't use different meanings of words than are in the dictionary you might be believable here you have several problems first you should know that words have more meanings than those given in the dictionary second it may come to be a shock for you to know that there are more words than those in the dictionary third we can exchange ideas if you want but you come out with this nonsense about being believable using the definitions given in a dictionary it seems that you cannot answer to the ideas given by others without insulting others sad if your facts at all resembled even the slightest bit of truth which they do not you might be believable if you did not put words in my mouth it might be that you might start reading what i had actually said so far you come over and over twisting what i said or presenting things i never said as if i had said them in this way you are answering to yourself that is why you do not find it believable maybe if you start reading what i had actually said and not what you added you might change your mind but the fact is that there is nothing resembling fact in what you've said on this thread and the fact also is that

soundly rejected the reasons are pragmatic even if bosnian muslims are croats and serbs who converted to islam under turkish rule centuries ago none of the present generation has any clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality in fact although i am forced to disagree with you first of all one may have been born from a nonturkish nonmuslim parent outside the turkish land yet still can be a turk provided this person calls himself or herself a turk because the designation of a turk is not a genetic feature not a racial or religious feature it is a matter of identifying with the turkish values secondly the following observations by westerners were written in french by ahmet cevat if turks had behaved like christians to use force to convert to islam the nations which they brought under their power to which no one could have opposed today there would be no eastern problem but turks did not do so they obeyed the word of the koran to permit everybody to worship in their own way centuries before frederick the great pronounced his famous dictum thus in an age when the christian europe itself shed christian blood and when people in europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs the ottoman empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist where deaths at the stake were unheard of and where accusations of witchcraft were not made and the barbarian turkey was the only country where the jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the christians could find asylum these facts demonstrate that muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than christian countries1 the turks who are a conquering nation did not turkify the nations that came under their rule instead they respected their religions and traditions it was a stroke of luck for romania to live under turkish rule instead of russian or austrian rule because otherwise there would not have been a romanian nation today popescu ciocanel turks rule over people under their administration only externally without interfering with their internal structures on account of this the autonomy of minorities in turkey is better and more complete than any in the most advanced european countries2 human beings hate each other on account of religious differences this flaw is older than islam and christianity but there has never been any examples of this adjuration in turkey because turks never oppress anybody on account of his religion if enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of simple contempt among us too or if it did not keep translating itself into action many nations in our europe would probably have considered themselves happy a de mortraye3 turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition on the contrary it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of christian fanaticism if you look into history you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of jews who were expelled from spain and portugal found such a good asylum in turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of christians especially that of the orthodoxes no jew is able to appear in public during easter celebrations in athens even today in turkey however if the israelites are insulted by the greek and armenian communities local courts immediately take them under their protection in that vast and calm country of the sultan all religions and nations are living together peacefully although the mosque is superior to the church and the synagogue it does not replace them because of this the catholic sect is more free in istanbul and smyrna compared with paris and lyon in addition to the fact that no law in turkey prohibits the openair ceremonies of this sect neither does any law imprison its cross in the church while the dead are being taken to the graves a long line of priests bear processional candles and chant catholic hymns when all the priests in all the churches in the galata and

older serbian agenda indeed so was annihilation of germans during wwii however it is important to quote adil zuflikarpasic in his interview to duga had serbs wanted to exterminate muslims they could have done it after the wwi when they were the most loved small nation in europe serbs did not do that although they supressed some rebellions by albanian muslims and bosnian muslims quite bloodily however this is quite a misrepresentation after wwi many bosnian muslims were killed and their land taken over by serbs and the motive was plunder not some fictitious supression of rebellion even earlier one can point to the destruction of mosques in serbia itself and expulsion of muslims here is what dr vaso cubrilovic political adviser to the serbian monarchic regime says in his memorandum the expulsion of the arnauts which he presented to the royal government of stojadinovic on march NUM NUM in belgrade the mode of removal describes how expulsion of ethnic albanians from kosova is to proceed through state terror and private initiative ie chetnik plunder private initiative too can assist greatly in this direction we should distribute weapons to our colonists as need be the old forms of chetnik action should be organized and secretly assisted the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and if need be ascribed to economic reasons finally local riots can be incited these will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the chetniks rather than the army there remains one more means which serbia employed with great practical effect after NUM that is by secretly burning down albanian villages and city quarters emphasis above is mine these events in serbia itself forced out virtually all muslims during late 19th century this policy of state terrorism against muslims aided by chetnik private initiative has continued in wwii and today for example muhamed hadzijahic in his book od tradicije do identiteta geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih muslimana sarajevo svjetlost NUM writes pg NUM how serbs killed a muslim in foca in wwii even though he claimed to be a serbian patriot explaining their action as follows inasmuch as you were a serb you sullied the serb name because you are a turk ie muslim and since you helped us we shall not torture you so the shot him instead of cutting his throat in the past year serbs have repeated the slaughter of muslim residents of foca destruction of mosques including priceless historical monuments completes the eradication of the muslim presence from territories claimed by serbs i strongly dispute your notion that croats had a similar older agenda in fact for the past century or two croats and muslims have seen themselves as having a lot in common and they generally had friendly relations your suggestion that croatmuslim relationship is anything like serbmuslim relationship is completely wrong to say that croats and muslims have a lot in common does not imply they are not separate peoples how touching i have nearly cried while i read this unfortunately mostly untrue which part do you claim is untrue explain yourself or withdraw your claim croats from croatia mostly had no contacts with muslims since they were mostly dealt with extreme preudice long time ago however one of the main agendas is turning bosnia into purely catholic state croatia never had many muslim citizens for historical reasons because it was not a part of the ottoman empire the last major battles between austrohungarian monarchy and the ottoman empire in croatia were at the end of the 17th century need i remind you that modern croatian nationalism came into being with dr ante starcevic who saw bosnian muslims as the best croats so much so that in NUM he contemplated moving his operations to sarajevo you are confusing clericalist croatianism with croatian nationalism here political nationalism has always been stronger as for your other theories you are clearly overjoyed that croatmuslim alliance in bosniaherzegovina is now in trouble arguments such as yours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split i should add few more things aj evans in his on foot through bh describes that catholic clergy in the last century was apparently more scared by serbs then by turks because serbs were growing stronger and unlike turks represented great danger for idea of catholic bosnia president tudjman clearly states in his book that muslims do not exist as a separate nation from croats and serbs and he many times suggested even in interviewes to foreign papers that solution is to split bosnia josip knows this and he is only working on the image of croatia in international relations NUM you'll learn that unless weak unite to counterbalance the strong player soon they are taken over and that's the end of them balance of power thinking has brought together croats and bosnian muslims this is only natural all other alignments are unstable i'm working on pointing out this basic fact croats and muslims have been aware of it for as long as serbia has existed you are wrong if you think only image is at stake here croatia has a deep interest in her alliance with bosnian muslims and vice versa i think tudjman understands this although he does not have much choice at this point tensions should have been defused better earlier before any open confrontation developed although i still think croatia will survive it will lose a lot but bosnian muslims may end up even worse off however their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not see it getting any worse the key point is do they still have any hope left if not then all bets are off mr stojanovic is clearly very very happy about this i'm deeply hurt this is not about some image but about survival of a concept of a partnership which i believe is natural and essential for both croats and muslims sigh josip\",\n",

driving a NUM toyota celica st and a NUM oldsmobile cutlass i have been interested in buying a sho for about five months and have been combing the classifieds in denver and chicago every week i bought a remarkably clean maroonred sho with 92k miles on it for NUM as far as i can tell this is about NUM under blue book and i still have another NUM miles before the extended service plan runs out as one should with any pre1991 shos i made sure that the car was already refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate as well as having been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments however my sho does not have the newer rod shifter i understand i can get this for NUM from any ford service center in addition the car received the full tuneup at 60k miles receiving new platinum plugs and valve adjustment for a car with 92k miles on it the car was virtually immaculate the clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents although the front airdammolding was covered with lots of small scratches not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the highway having driven a smaller twodoor coupe for so long i was a bit concerned about whether i could get used to driving a larger car to my surprise the size of the car doesn't bother me at all it seems just as nimble as my celica no comparisons with my oldsmobile visibility from the driver's seat is excellent helped mostly by of the small the quarterwindows aft of the backseat door windows and in front of the cpillar and rear window parallel parking is a bit more difficult but other than that i love the size in fact i'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as i pack up for a 14hour drive to washington dc for the summer more on the ride later in this review engine as with anyone even slightly interested in shos i was very interested in the 24valve 30l yamaha shogun engine i was not disappointed base performance of the engine under NUM rpms is good you can even do reasonable launches from second gear although i don't make a practice of this the engine revs smoothly and eagerly tooling around town does not require many shifts this is good since the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car more on this later while the performance of the engine under NUM rpms may be unremarkable it undergoes a jekyllhyde transformation once you hit higher revs at NUM rpms a butterfly valve opens and you can literally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve more valves open up the engine soars to its NUM rpm redline and you are treated to in my opinion the sweetest sounding v6 around the engine inexplicably sounds overjoyed to be at NUM rpm i've noticed that when i drive around town i constantly watch the tach to see how far below NUM rpm i am to go from NUM rpm to NUM you may have to punch the accelerator while torque is more than adequate it doesn't come fully online until those other NUM valves are used transmission when car and driver first reviewed the car in NUM they marvelled at how ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter into the car i remember driving a friend's parent's sho in NUM and remember thinking about whether i had the leg strength to drive the car in traffic the clutch was that stiff that was back then the entire clutch assembly on my sho has been replaced under a ford recall in NUM the clutch on the sho feels no stiffer than the one on my toyota celica in fact the friction point seems a bit larger and more forgiving when playing with the shifter with the car parked the shifter felt very reasonable the NUM and NUM gates were where you'd expect it to be and the shifting action was smooth on the road it's much the same but you have to shift slowly make no mistake it's a clumsy shifter when hurrying shifts like when i was initially trying to impress friends i consistently miss the NUM shift often grope clumsily for the NUM shift and sometimes even muff the NUM shift i find this pretty amazing in a car like this it also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest shifts when you take your time seems obvious but compared to my toyota and my friend's honda this seems atrocious and clumsy someone on recautos noted that crxs should blow shos offtheline because of the incredibly clumsy shifter i now shift much more sedately and the shifter seems more reasonable when you play within these bounds the shifter works smoothly with no surprises i don't know whether the rod shifter upgrade would help at all along these same lines i initially had trouble shifting gears smoothly again slowing down the shifts and taking more care to match revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely this took several days for me to get the hang of i think some of my problems were because i've never had a car with enough power to balk at bad shifts in higher gears occasionally i have trouble shifting into reverse the shifter refuses to enter the gate and i often grind the synchros trying to get it into gear i'll be watching this carefully in the next couple of months a quirk when i upshift and the engine drops back to NUM rpm i hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the engine compartment not terribly loud but the passenger can definitely hear it i asked about it when i was looking at the car as do all my passengers apparently this is a definitely a sho sound and is the gearbox apparently called gear rollover replies to my queries on recautos are at the end of this review exterior as i mentioned before i am astounded by how well the body of this sho has stood up paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are virtually nonexistent looking at how older tauri sometimes don't age so gracefully i wonder what the guys at ford did differently to the sho bodies the body in my opinion is extremely attractive with matching color body moldings than the stock tauri for some odd reason the sho seems different enough from vanilla tauri to get stares at stoplights of course this could be my overactive imagination shos get fog lights a more open grille a completely monochromatic exterior and a deeper ground skirt in the back with sho stenciled in relief i've seen a couple shos whose owners have colored these in with florescent colors or in black yuck i don't think the car is flashy i like it that way i feel almost anonymous with all those tauri out there but different and distinctive enough to those of us who care interior the interior is what really makes me feel like i don't deserve the car the seats are grey leather the steering wheel and shifter are covered with black leather and the entire instrument panel is done in a blackgreymetallic scheme the instrumentation is stock taurus except for the NUM mph speedo and NUM rpm tach you get a center console with two cupholders a large compartment under the radio great for a cd player an armrest that contains yet another compartment three appropriately sized coin holders for tollways i think and a compartment for holding cassette tapes there's mapholders in the doors and an oddly small glove compartment i spilled a whole can of coke in the cupholder and was delighted to find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a sink hey i'm really impressed with the ergonomics and thoughtfulness that went into its design and it's a NUM before the interior was upgraded the backseat is bigger than any car i've had why do they need so much space no smartass comments please the driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters from what i hear it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear mine is no exception the left side bolster on the driver's has cracked and i'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the way a big surprise for me i forgot that shos don't have a normal hand parking brake instead they have the regular parking brake that you press with your left foot too bad again i'm getting used to it but it seems a bit anachronistic to me ride the suspension is nice and stiff too stiff it's stiffer than any car i've had a friend's new NUM toyota celica st seems tauter and is still able to soak up bumps better the sho seems stiffer with less ability to soak up bumps driving over railroad tracks is a noisy and jarring affair on the other hand taking turns feels wonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all i listened for that before i bought the car on the highway the ride is great when i drove the car from chicago back to purdue i had trouble keeping under NUM mph let alone from trying to see what NUM mph really feels like it's a relatively quiet ride but the sunroof rattles i've tried to find out what exactly makes all the noise up there but it seems to be the window that rests on the rails no easy way to get rid of it i think over the past three days i've oscillated between thinking the suspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way too rough not for me mind you but i wonder whether i would advise my dad to buy one for himself but i've discovered as with the shifter if you take your time with shifts you'll have no reason to complain let me explain the ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the wheels i feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer making the car skitter left and right after i understood this i avoid the limits of traction and i'm a happy camper again it's not body rigidity but the composure of the car as if matching the suspension the steering feel is quite heavy my first impression of driving my sho was how hard you had to turn the wheel at highway speeds it tracks straight as an arrow but when driving around a parking lot the higheffort steering didn't seem so useful however it's reasonable but it doesn't communicate the road to the driver as well as a NUM ford probe gt imho it's much better than the steering on my celica st i wonder how bad this car is during winter miscellaneous notes gripes the rattles from the sunroof is intermittent some days it rattles loudly other days i look up wondering where all the noise went activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy loud squealing as it retracts on its rails i wonder if there is a quick fix for this again other days it completely disappears function of humidity once i made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension and torque steer i've never complained about ride i wish the seats had more support under the thighs also i wish the side bolsters would close more tightly i hear that tires for this car can get really expensive i currently have goodyear gt4s that cost the previous owner NUM for four i used to hate the ford stereo systems whose idea was it to use a volume paddle now to my amazement i don't really mind and sometimes think it's an okay idea pretty ridiculous though getting up to NUM rpm sometimes seems to be a chore but this is no big deal there is more than enough torque down low i often goof up the shifting when driving with friends it took me a couple of days before i could really shift smoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear hard to believe isn't it my car has almost NUM miles on it my parents noted that it is almost impossible to find a lowmileage sho astute observation imho i wonder how long i can make my sho last i just bought a book titled drive it forever for tips in this department the goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop i once parked the car in gear and then accidentally let out the clutch after i started it the car jolted forward and bounced off the car in front of me no paint damage at all but starting the car is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal also i began to wonder how strong that brake really is today i backed out of parking spot today and started to drive away before i noticed the glowing brake light oops the driver's power window creaks when closed all the way the same thing happens in my parents NUM mercury sable oddly all the other windows work smoothly likes i'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day the cupholders are great i didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much but it really is handy you can lock all the doors by pressing the NUM and NUM buttons together neat and you can never lock yourself out of the car i really feel like i don't deserve this car i really can't believe that i could afford it i got this car ten years ahead of schedule i love this car so much that i've been telling my parents to look into buying one i love this car so much that i wrote this 13k file i meant to write a couple of lines and ended up with this if there were a jd powers survey for used car owners i would have an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this car i don't like thinking about getting another car but at this point in time i'm sure i'd buy another sho for under NUM you can't beat it next time with an airbag and abs though insurancewise this car is also a big win i pay the same premiums as on my NUM toyota celica despite that it has nearly twice the horsepower other odds and ends much to my amazement there is no sho mailing list anywhere maybe because the sho registry publication has filled this void i haven't joined yet but i've noticed that queries about shos still appear on recautos about once a month owners of shos are always quick to respond and are very vocal fans of the cars maybe some of the most vocal on recautos i've put together the responses to my questions about the cars as well as other posts with useful information on these cars i'll be posting this in the form of a faq soon if anyone is interested in starting a mailing list please speak up i don't know if i have the resources here at purdue to start one but maybe

do get the squeal that bill describes i live in seattle so the wet weather may be a factor ford only gives NUM key with the car c'mon ford spend an extra few pennies if i recall correctly i got two keys horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference you'vegottopositionthefingersperfectlytomakeitbeep buttons are terrible this is true i'm wondering if this may be a safety concern ie if people pound on the place where the airbag lives speaking of the horn i was surprised to find that the probe comes with one of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the japanese sounding kind the previous probes had japanese horns no opinion transmission the NUM speed is a must i have always been a 5speed guy almost every car i've ever owned has been a 5speed because i got a good deal on this car with the NUM miles i knowingly overlooked the fact that it has an automatic but it is a pretty hightech automatic it is a fully electronicaly controlled 4speed with the NUM speed is much more fun we opted for the automatic for a number of reasons but it's still fun and in some ways more practical no shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still ditto shakes and rattles has been my main gripe i've gotten them to fix the worst of them but i fear that with the rather harsh ride the car will be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older i too would suspect that this may be true tires 22555vr16 goodyear eagles NUM left hoping for 30k very very very well it sticks to the road like glue even on a rough surface yes interior is very very nice too very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically sound definitely fordmazda did a very very nice job on this one the car has a much more expensive than it actually is look and feel to it ditto yes this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car i'd strongly suggest looking into the mx6 agree check it out i don't mind it but would say that if it was much stiffer it might be a problem how about the '93 r1 rx7 for suspension well i wouldn't encourage passengercarrying in the probe unless the person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash as mentioned in the consumer reports writeups consider the back seat as a parcel shelf no biggie to me though if it had been i'd not have bought the car but it's definitely not a family car true i've heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine i haven't heard about this one i know that some of the very early probes '89 and maybe '90 had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which i've had this problem and read about it or at least i assume the one i had was the one i read about in any case what happened was the weld between the muffler and the pipe feeding it ok so i'm not a mechanic broke in my case the dealer welded it ordered replacement parts and put them on when they got them i suspect this is some sort of NUM design flaw or NUM production flaw in any case i have an earlier model and would expect it to be worked out on newer ones in any case it is a warrantee repair or they get the keys back from what i've heard it sounds like fordmazda had some qc problems with the probe and probably mx6 when they first went into production but i think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point that's almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though i have to agree that they seem to have some qc problesm but i seriously feel the car design is sound and expect it to do very well i

jeremy g mereness zonkercmuedu says can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc some other owners on the fordprobeworldstdcom mailing list have commented about this problem but i haven't seen it happen on my NUM month old '93 probe gt i think this may be something that ford has corrected since the initial batch of cars also someone said that ford has issued a service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem so you may be able to get your dealer to fix it i have had my probe looked at twice by my local dealer where i purchased the car the first time they made this problem worse the second time after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my fordprobe mailing list they said they didn't know of the bulletin they adjusted the window and made it much better however it now makes a scritch scritch noise on rough roads and still squeals when i openclose the window in wet weather anyone elses's do this ford only gives NUM key with the car c'mon ford spend an extra few pennies i got two keys with my car but only one remoteentry pushbutton thingie but then i bought my NUM with NUM miles and i think it may have been a repossession so i'm not surprised something was missing horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference i am seriously considering following the advice in the owners manual where it describes the procedure to follow if you discover something on your ford that could cause serious injury threaten lives etc something about notifying the national traffic safety group as well as ford those little you'vegottopositionthefingersperfectlytomakeitbeep buttons are terrible the latter is probably because of the air bag it's pretty much takes up all the space where you'd expect to find the horn speaking of the horn i was surprised to find that the probe comes with one of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the japanese sounding kind the previous probes had japanese horns well i guess that's good in a way but in a way it's bad when someone hears that kind of horn they expect to see a big american car they may not associate the sound with a small jap car style car like the probe is tires fling dirtmud onto side of car yeah not very badly but enough to be annoying sometimes the mudflaps help a lot transmission the NUM speed is a must i have always been a 5speed guy almost every car i've ever owned has been a 5speed because i got a good deal on this car with the NUM miles i knowingly overlooked the fact that it has an automatic but it is a pretty hightech automatic it is a fully electronicaly controlled 4speed with torque converter lockup even with the automatic i'm getting NUM mpg on the highway driving NUM but of course driving NUM is illegal so i probably made that sentence up around town the mileage has been around NUM not bad for an automatic of course it doesn't have the control of a 5speed but since i do a lot of city driving it turns out to be very convenient it's nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and drive at the same time although that too is illegal here in weliketocontrolyourlife massachusetts no shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still shakes and rattles has been my main gripe i've gotten them to fix the worst of them but i fear that with the rather harsh ride the car will be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older tires 22555vr16 goodyear eagles NUM left hoping for 30k on my NUM probe gl i got about 40k out of the original goodyears and had driven the replacement tires bridgestone 50k miles when i tradeed the car the 1956560vr14 firestones on my NUM probe look like they're designed for performance ie rather wide shallow tread etc so they probably won't last as long but the car handles very very very well it sticks to the road like glue even on a rough surface interior is very very nice too very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically sound definitely fordmazda did a very very nice job on this one the car has a much more expensive than it actually is look and feel to it yes this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car i'd strongly suggest looking into the mx6 having driven an NUM probe for NUM years i find the NUM suspension interesting the car actually drives much better than the NUM it is a very firm ride and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road yet the car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads you hear and feel the bumps yet the car retains its posture very well if you have NUM passengers by all means bring them along too they'll find that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides differently if that's better is up to you well i wouldn't encourage passengercarrying in the probe unless the person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash as mentioned in the consumer reports writeups consider the back seat as a parcel shelf no biggie to me though if it had been i'd not have bought the car but it's definitely not a family car also there's a lot of glass around you which i wasn't expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer ac is a must on any probe from NUM NUM the NUM in particular sends out a real blast of cool air when the ac is on max that lots of glass you mentioned is what gives the car the very good visibility reports you see in all the writeups most sportssporty cars don't have that good visibility i've heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine i haven't heard about this one i know that some of the very early probes '89 and maybe '90 had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which the complaints i've heard re exhaust system on 93's have been on the gt of course being a different engine that is a differeent exhaust system i was one of those with an NUM who qualified for the free replacement since i had already replaced the muffler when i received the notice i wasam due a refund from ford i applied in february and am still waiting gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that i was without my car i was quite happy with the way they handledespecially considering that i was expecting the worst from them yes i was pretty amazed when i had my car in for some touchup adjustments this past week and they had to keep it overnight too busy for them to get to it and they offered to pay for a rental they did make me pay for taxes and insurance though from what i've heard it sounds like fordmazda had some qc problems with the probe and probably mx6 when they first went into production but i think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point that's almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though i have to agree that they seem to have some qc problesm but i seriously feel the car design is sound and

       "  \"subject review audi s4 quattro organization skulls 'r us lines NUM distribution world replyto eliotengrwashingtonedu eliot nntppostinghost lanmolaengrwashingtonedu it's been a while since i've reviewed a car but today i paid a visit to an old friend whose love for audis has been so overwhelming that he makes a not too sucessful living selling them without further delay i will get to the NUM audi s4 NUM servotronic steering for those who are not familiar with what servotronic is it is the name for the speed variable power steering manufactured by zf and used in audis and bmws i have been outspoken in my damming of servotronic over the past couple of months and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of the audi NUM cs quattro and the audi 100cs fwd i am quite happy to report now that on the s4 the servotronic is inoffensive i suppose that due to the fat gumball tires the servotronic has been loaded up more and this so far has been the best implementation that i have tried it is far from perfect mind you and i'd be much happier if it was an option that i could refuse but on the s4 i no longer consider this to be bad enough where i feel the entire car is ruined the steering is still a tad too light but it is accurate and i suppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that some makes it through to the driver's hands so there is feel and there is accuracy in the s4's steering but there is also room for improvement i consider the s4's steering to be better than the japanese competition primarily because the japanese do not believe in feel and engineer it out completely NUM engine wheee what a pressure cooker with just NUM miles on the clock i did not expect the s4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be putting out NUM miles later but still the car packs a terrific punch for a turbocharged machine it is very unusual in that it encourages lazy driving ie low revs high gear it is so supremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there's only NUM liters of displacement to move this NUM pound car around in such a fashion with maximum torque available at NUM rpm and a NUM rpm redline the car can pretty much be left in third all day which translates to a speed range of something like NUM mph a chracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity v8s the technical achievement is breadthtaking throttle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine in fact it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame downshifts are almost unnecessary it is more fun to use the overboost feature than to rev the engine for those not familiar the s4 engine features up to NUM seconds of additional turbo boost for passing sort of like lighting up the after burners in a jet fighter one could with the right foot only in third gear blast the car from NUM to NUM in just a few moments simply by flooring the gas as far as the numbers go maximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about NUM lb ft incredible for a NUM liter it takes a few moments for it to develop overboost but it is well worth waiting for since this is quite a heavy car one's body parts are not flung around like say the corrado vr6 the acceleration is smooth and strong somewhat similar to riding in a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff also one is treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the turbo the only entertaining sound to come out of a very refined but bland sounding NUM banger yes audi has refined the NUM to the point where at NUM rpm it sounds as serene as it does at NUM the smoothness is outstanding but not quite up to the standards of a very good NUM eg a NUM valve bmw i'd say that in terms of refinement ie willingness to rev smoothness lack of harshness under full acceleration it is better than many v6s however lost in the refinement process is the characteristic NUM cylinder bark that made the older engines so characterful if not terribly refined the NUM valve turbo NUM sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under full boost subjectively i'd rate the vw vr6 engine as being far more musical than the turbo NUM also audi's own v8 is also far more musical with a rorty race car growl when pressed though none of these can match its grunt the only hint of the engine's true capacity occurs when one is taking off from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop with the extra inertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system one has to be somewhat delicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall alternately one could use more revs in both cases a very small price to pay for such a fantastic engine i think that audi of america should offer an automatic option for this car just as they offer though in extremely small numbers a NUM speed for the much peakier v8 the characteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic ironically in europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the slush marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again NUM chassis i've noticed that audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively modest tire widths the car comes with firestones of size NUM zr16 which is not uncommon at all however the very attractive NUM spoke wheels are no less than NUM inches wide so there is no sidewall bulge whatsoever combined with the flared wheel arches the s4 has a mouth watering macho yet subdued look on rough concrete it becomes immediately clear that the new NUM body style has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as road noise suppression i suppose the two are interrelated but i digress to use a cliche the s4's body feels like it has been carved out of stone flex is totally undetectable even when going over rough roads with a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers do not cause excessive harshness and while the s4's ride quality will never worry a lexus it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or pony cars the servotronic steering has already been mentioned i consider it to be inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering i was able to test the car's cornering powers without too much trepidation i think a new concept is at work in this car with its fat gumball tires talking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless on a banked highway on ramp i went in slow and started applying power as i went around i could feel the g forces build to the point where the skin on my face was being tugged sideways yet the car was totally and completely obedient to throttle and steering inputs it felt that the limits were not even close to being approached the g forces were thrilling but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely uninvolving you tell the car what you want and it does it end of story i think that i am starting to relate more and more to those reviewers who were highly impressed by the honda nsx's clinical efficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car the brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty well too though i've read that they are prone to fade i am not too surprised since the s4 does not have uprated brakes over the base audi NUM fwd harder pads would help but that in turn would lead to a more wooden response when cold i am starting to see a trend among the luxurysports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by additional braking capacity the ls400's fade performance is nothing to brag about neither is the q45's or the legend's brake fade these days seem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody's attention is focused on antilock capability NUM comfort for a car with such sporty abilities its comfort levels are also excellent the cabin is beautifully appointed with carbonfiber panel inserts in place of the wood trim of the '92 s4 all the expected gizmos are there heated seats power seats seat memory power this and that the glaring ommision was the trip computer which was removed because audi hasn't gotten it to work reliably yet that means that the car has no boost gauge a real disappointment taking into account how much the turbo dominates its performance unusual for the germans the s4 comes with a honda style moonroof as well as the very intelligent dialasunroofposition rotary switch noise levels including engine and tire noise is so low that i wouldn't consider the lexus' advantage in this area to be significant enough to sway a potential buyer NUM conclusion even though few will be able to afford an audi s4 at its sticker price of 48k the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to offer over the competition the NUM valve turbo NUM is a real gem even if it doesn't produce ferrari sounds no other luxurysports sedan maker offers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive which to some is worth the extra money all by itself the safety features are also top notch NUM side impact standard compliant the very elegant automatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags the NUM series audis have been outstanding in government crash tests it gets my thumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being all out exciting and intoxicating eliot\",\n",

from rtfmmitedu NUM in the directory pubusenetnewsanswersmacintosh except for this introductory faq which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as generalfaqz the name of each file has the format of the last part of the group name followed by faqz eg the faq for compsysmacsystem is stored as systemfaqz and the faq for compsysmacmisc is stored as miscfaqz rtfm stores files as compressed z binary files if you leave off the z at the end of the file name when getting the file rtfm will automatically decompress the file before sending it to you you can also have these files mailed to you

you can also send this server a message with the subject help for more detailed instructions i have a question NUM congratulations you've come to the right place usenet is a wonderful resource for

wdef NUM and nvir NUM from my system file and used the hex editor to add code string a67b45 as a patch to the sfgetfile routine so the standard file dialog box would be a nice shade of mauve everything worked fine until i installed supercdevblaster and now when i use the aldus driver to print from pagemaker 50d4 to a linotronic NUM my system hangs ps i'm running system NUM on a powerbook NUM since the macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume we ask that you first peruse this faq list including at least the table of contents for the other pieces of it check any other relevant online resources listed below in question NUM especially the faq lists for the other macintosh newsgroups and rtfm read the friendly manual before posting your question we realize that you are personally incensed that the system is taking up fourteen of your newlyinstalled twenty megs of ram but this question has already made its way around the world three hundred times before and it's developing tired feet finally before posting to any newsgroup macintosh or otherwise please familiarize yourself with the basic etiquette of usenet as described in the newsgroup newsannouncenewusers how do i use this document where can i get it NUM compsysmacfaq is currently divided into multiple pieces a general introduction which you're reading now and specific lists for the newsgroups compsysmacsystem and compsysmacmisc faq lists for compsysmacwanted compsysmacapps and compsysmachardware are in development when ready each part will be available in its respective newsgroup all pieces are available via anonymous ftp from rtfmmitedu in the pubusenetnewsanswersmacintosh directory except for this document itself which is named generalfaqz the pieces are named as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover followed by faq eg systemfaqz miscfaqz the z means the file is stored compressed so you'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use either maccompress stuffit deluxe or the unix uncompress command to decompress it however if you leave off the z extension when you get the file rtfm will automatically decompress the file before sending it to you this introductory document is posted to all of the concerned newsgroups the tables of contents for each of the specific faq lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to get at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere else in the faq even if you don't have the other parts at hand it's not always obvious especially to newcomers where a particular question or comment should be posted please familiarize yourself with the faq lists in all the major macintosh newsgroups before posting in any of them which questions appear in which faqs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong where to jump to a particular question search for sectionnumberquestionnumber enclosed in parentheses for example to find where can i ftp macintosh software search for the string NUM to jump to a section instead of a question use a zero for the question number what other information is available NUM compsysmacfaq provides short answers to a number of frequently asked questions appropriate for the usenet newsgroup compsysmacmisc and compsysmacsystem four other files are worthy of particular note daryl spitzer maintains a faq list covering macintosh programming for the newsgroup compsysmacprogrammer it's posted to that group weekly and available for anonymous ftp from ftpcsuoregon NUM in pubmac eric rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list for compsysmaccomm available in that newsgroup and from rascalicsutexasedu in macfaq where the file you're reading now is also irregularly archived this list answers many frequently asked questions about networking unix and the mac telecommunications and foreign file formats norm walsh has compiled an excellent faq for compfonts that answers a lot of questions about the various kinds of fonts and crossplatform conversion and printing it's available in compfonts or by ftp from ibiscsumassedu in pubnormcompfontsfaq finally jim jagielski maintains a faq for compunixaux covering apple's unix environment aux it's posted every NUM to NUM weeks in compunixaux and newsanswers it's available for anonymous ftp at jaguboxgsfcnasagov which newsgroup should i post to NUM there are no stupid questions but there are misplaced ones you wouldn't ask your english teacher how to do the definite integral of ln x between zero and one would you so don't ask the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when microsoft word is in the background ignorance of basic netiquette is not an excuse if you want people to help you you need to learn their ways of communicating posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your mailbox with pearls of wisdom and maybe a few rotten oysters too posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering silence for instance the most common and glaring mispost one that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the macintosh regions of usenet as would a purple elephant to aleuts in the arctic asking a question about networking anywhere except compsysmaccomm normally produces no useful responses posting the same question to compsysmaccomm ensures that your post is read and considered by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few network software designers please post to exactly one newsgroup do not crosspost if a question isn't important enough for you to take the extra minute to figure out where it properly belongs it's not important enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading for the same reason compsysmacmisc should not be used as a catchall newsgroup the breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs where specifically questions about productivity applications software you bought your macintosh to run not software you bought to make your macintosh run better should go to compsysmacapps unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup communications programs games hypercard compilers and databases all have more topical compsysmac newsgroups post questions about noncommunications hardware including questions about what software is necessary to make particular hardware work to compsysmachardware questions about macos system software belong in compsysmacsystem questions about utilities and extensions normally belong in compsysmacmisc questions about aux go to compunixaux detailed questions about appletalk belong in compprotocolsappletalk direct questions about hypercard to compsysmachypercard nonhypercard programming questions and questions about development environments should go to compsysmacprogrammer resedit questions may be posted either to compsysmacmisc compsysmacsystem or compsysmacprogrammer but generally the netters who inhabit the darker recesses of compsysmacprogrammer are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking a general exception to the above rules is that any very technical question about an application that actually begins to delve into the how's of a program as well as the what's recent example how does writenow which is written entirely in assembly compare to other word processors written in high level languages might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup for sale and want to buy posts should go to compsysmacwanted and miscforsalecomputersmac only we understand that you're desperate to sell your upgraded 128k mac to get the for a powerbook NUM but trust me anyone who wants to buy it will be reading compsysmacwanted political and religious questions the mac is better than windows is not is too is not is too hey how 'bout the amiga what about it is not is too belong in compsysmacadvocacy anything not specifically mentioned above probably belongs in compsysmacmisc finally don't be so provincial as to consider only the compsysmac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions many questions about modems in compsysmaccomm are much more thoroughly discussed in compdcommodems questions about mac midi are often better handled in compmusic even though it's not a macintosh specific newsgroup shop around usenet's a big place and not everything relevant to the macintosh happens in compsysmac NUM someone just asked why the system was taking up sixteen of their twenty megabytes of ram shouldn't i put my brilliance and wit on display for the world by posting the seventeenth response no frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as frequent questions unless you really have something new to add to the traditional answers such as the recent discovery that fonts in system NUM could eat memory private email is a much better medium for answering common questions like this one you might want to add a mention of this faq in your email response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it before posting future questions i do read all the newsgroups covered here and have written a small script in microphone ii that lets me send pwfaq's people with frequently asked questions the section of this document that answers their question with just the click of a button so please don't feel obligated to respond to someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they can't be troubled to read the faq list to get it ftp NUM where can i ftp mac software NUM the three major north american internet archives of shareware freeware and demo software are sumexaimstanfordedu NUM macarchiveumichedu NUM and wuarchivewustledu NUM which mirrors the other two sites and several others wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove them for space concerns and still has files that were deleted from the formerly important site rascalicsutexasedu rascal was notable for storing its files in macbinary format rather than the less efficient binhex format common at the other archives unless otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document should be available at the above sites to keep traffic on the internet manageable scandinavians should try connecting to ftpfunetfi NUM ftplthse NUM or sicsse NUM instead those in the uk should look first at srcdocicacuk NUM continental europeans can try nicswitchch NUM ezinfoethzch NUM and anlanlfr192541791 australian users should try to find what they want at archieau NUM which mirrors infomac and macarchive japanese users will find sumex mirrored at ftputokyoacjp NUM a fourth very important site is ftpapplecom NUM this is apple's semiofficial repository for system software developer tools source code technical notes and other things that come more or less straight from apple's mouth some material at this site may not be distributed outside the us or by other sites that don't have an official license to distribute apple system software please read the various readme documents available at ftpapplecom for the detailed info if you're connecting from outside the us or if you wish to redistribute material you find here can i get shareware by email NUM the infomac archives at sumexaim are available by email from listservricevm1bitnet alternately listservricevm1riceedu the listserver responds to the commands macarch help macarch index and macarch get filename mac archive files are available from macmacarchiveumichedu send it a message containing the words help and index no quotes on the first two lines of your message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files you may request you can retrieve files from other sites by using the server at ftpmaildecwrldeccom for details send it a message with just the text help no quotes where can i find application x NUM if you can't find what you're looking for at one of the above sites try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it an email message addressed to archie with the subject help archie servers are located at archierutgersedu NUM america archiemcgillca NUM the original archie server in canada archieau NUM australia archiefunetfi NUM scandinavia and archiedocicacuk NUM the uk and the continent these sites index the tens of thousands of files available for anonymous ftp login as archie no password is needed and type prog filename to find what you're looking for or type help for more detailed instructions for instance you would type prog disinfectant to search for a convenient ftp site for disinfectant if the initial search fails to turn up the file you want try variations on and substrings of the name for instance if you didn't find disinfectant with prog disinfectant you might try prog disi instead substring searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross to avoid many erroneous matches add a hqx to the end of the substring eg prog disihqx most mac software available on the net ends in hqx but almost no unix or pc software does please check the above archives and archie personally before asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware if you follow the above advice you should almost never have to ask the net where to find a particular piece of software can someone mail me application x NUM no nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from compbinariesmac that was corrupt or missed at your site please refer to the first questions in this section to find out about anonymous ftp archie and automatic email servers what is bin hqx cpt etc NUM most files available by ftp are modified twice to allow them to more easily pass through foreign computer systems first they're compressed to make them faster to download and then they're translated to either a binhex hqx or macbinary bin format that other computers can digest the macintosh uses a special twofork filing system that chokes most other computers binhex files are 7bit ascii text files while macbinary files are pure 8bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary protocol how a file has been translated and compressed for transmission is indicated by its suffix normally a file will have a name something like filenamexxxyyy xxx indicates how it was compressed and yyy indicates how it was translated to use a file you've ftp'd and downloaded to your mac you'll need to reverse the process most files you get from the net require a twostep decoding process first change the binhex hqx or macbinary bin file to a doubleclickable macintosh file then decompress it which programs decode which file types is covered in the table below also note that most macintosh telecommunications programs will automatically convert macbinary files to regular macintosh files as they are downloaded suffix sit cpt hqx bin pit z image dd zip uu tar extractors stuffit NUM x x x x x compact pro x x packit x uutool x maccompress x suntar x x x x binhex NUM x binhex NUM x diskdoubler x x unzip x diskcopy x macutil x x x x a few notes on the decompressors stuffit is a family of products that use several different compression schemes the freeware stuffit expander will unstuff all of them versions of stuffit earlier than NUM stuffit NUM stuffit classic unstuffit and stuffit deluxe NUM and NUM will not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by stuffit NUM you need to get a more recent version of stuffit or stuffit expander stuffit NUM lite and deluxe consistently makes smaller archives than any other macintosh compression utility to allow maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep netbandwidth down please compress all files you send to anonymous ftp sites with stuffit NUM uutool maccompress and suntar handle the popular unix formats of uuencode uu compress z and tar tar respectively the unix versions are often more robust than the mac products so use them instead when that's an option translators that allow stuffit lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also available by anonymous ftp macutil is dik winter's package of unix utilities to decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading them to a mac since unix stores files differently than does the mac macutil creates macbinary bin files which should be automatically converted on download it can't decompress everything in particular it can't decompress the new stuffit NUM archives however if you need only one or two files out of an archivefor instance if you want to read the readme to find out if a program does what you need it to do before you download all of itmacutil is indispensable it can be found at sumexaim in the infomacunix directory a few notes on the compression formats bin these are macbinary files always use a binary file transfer protocol when transferring them never ascii or text most files on the net are stored as hqx instead only rascal stores most of its files in bin format most communications programs such as zterm and mackermit are capable of translating macbinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance they'll be downloading macbinary files image this format is normally used only for system software so that online users can download files that can easily be converted into exact copies of the installer floppies instead of using diskcopy to restore the images to floppies you can use steve christensen's freeware utility mountimage to treat the images on your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive mountimage has a reputation for being buggy so you should have some blank floppies and a copy of diskcopy handy just in case sea x x sea files don't merit a position in the above table because they're selfextracting they may have been created with compact pro stuffit or even diskdoubler but all should be capable of decompressing themselves when doubleclicked for some unknown reason alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard designation for selfextracting archives created with their payware products superdisk and more disk space instead they append either x or x to selfextracting archives how can i get binhex stuffit etc NUM by far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human being to copy them onto a floppy for you if you're at a university there's absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to give you a copy and if you're anywhere less remote than mcmurdo sound chances are very good that someone at a computer center dealership or user group can provide you with a copy of stuffit once you have stuffit any version you don't need binhex if you're such a computer geek that the thought of actually asking a living breathing human being instead of a computer terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of protoplasmic jelly you can probably download a working copy of stuffit from a local bulletin board system if you have religious objections to software gotten by any means other than anonymous ftp then i suppose i'll mention that you can in fact ftp a working copy of stuffit though this is by far the hardest way to get it ftp to wuarchivewustledu and login type the word binary hit return type cd mirrorsrascalicsutexaseducompression and hit return then get stuffitexpander101seabin and hit return of course it's always possible that by the time you read this stuffit expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this fails look for something similar if you've ftp'd straight onto your mac you should now have a selfextracting archive which will produce a working copy of stuffit expander when doubleclicked if you've ftp'd to your mainframe or unix account first you still need to use a modem program to download it to your mac just make sure that the mac is receiving in macbinary mode and the mainframe is sending in binary mode if you need more details on the last step consult the faq list for compsysmaccomm and the manuals for both your mainframe and macintosh telecommunications software how can i get binhex stuffit etc from a pc NUM you can't there is absolutely no way to get an executable macintosh file from an ftp site onto a pc and then onto your mac without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp you must beg borrow or steal the necessary software such as binhex or stuffit lite from another person i realize this may terrify those among you who haven't left your parents' basement since you got an apple ii in NUM but eventually you're going to need to link up with some human being other than your mother though i suppose if you're this much of a nerd you could send your mother out to get it for you while you're gathering your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world of daylight please don't bother the net by asking this question again there simply is no way to move executable macintosh programs from a pc or other nonmacintosh computer onto a mac without software that is not bundled with most macs troubleshooting what to do before posting when things go wrong NUM while the various faq lists cover a lot of specific problems there are far more problems that aren't covered here these are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking for help you should probably also perform the tenstep preventative maintenance routine described in section four especially rebuilding the desktop NUM and resizing the system heap NUM following these steps may or may not solve your problem but it will at least make it easier for others to recommend solutions to you identify the problem NUM microsoft word is crashing doesn't say much what were you doing when it crashed can you repeat the actions that lead to the crash the more information you provide about the actions preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you the more precisely you've identified the problem and the actions preceding it step NUM the easier it will be to tell if the following steps fix the problem for example sometimes quarkxpress NUM crashes with a coprocessor not installed error is not nearly as helpful as quarkxpress NUM crashes when i link two text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already contain text the former will leave you wondering whether the bug remains after a given step the latter lets you go right to the problem and see if it's still there or not read the read me file NUM many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and bugs in their read me files often these aren't documented in the manual read any read me files to see if any of the problems sound familiar check for viruses NUM run disinfectant or another antiviral across your disk virus infections are rarer than most people think but they do occur and they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do reinstall the application and all its support files NUM for half a dozen reasons external magnetic fields improperly written software the alignment of the planets a file on a disk may not contain the data it's supposed to contain this can cause all types of unexplained unusual behavior restoring from original masters will normally fix this reinstall the system software NUM bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous see question NUM for a detailed procedure for performing a clean reinstall if the problem continues to occur after you've taken these steps chances are you've found either a conflict between your application and some other software or a genuine bug in the program so it's time to isolate the problem NUM you need to find the minimal system on which the problem will assert itself here are the basic steps of isolating the cause of a system or application crash a\\trun only one application at a time occasionally applications do conflict with each other if the problem does not manifest itself without other applications running simultaneously you can begin launching other applications until you find the one that causes the crash b\\tif you're running system NUM turn off multifinder if you're running system NUM allot as much memory to the application as you can afford sometimes programs just need more memory especially when performing complicated operations c if you're running system NUM turn off virtual memory and 32bit addressing there's still an awful lot of system NUM hostile software out there including some from companies that really have no excuse can you say microsoft word NUM boys and girls i knew you could some of this software only expresses its incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken d\\tboot from a virgin system floppy if the problem disappears you likely have an init conflict you need to progressively remove extensions until the problem vanishes use a little common sense when choosing the first extensions to remove if the problem occurs when you try to open a file remove any inits that mess with the standard file open procedure such as super boomerang first if the problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or if you have a lot of them perform a binary search by removing half of the extensions at a time once the problem disappears add half of the most recently removed set back continue until you've narrowed the conflict down to one extension when you think you've found the offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem contact technical support NUM by now you should have a very good idea of when where and why the conflict occurs if a tech support number is available for the software call it if you're lucky the company will have a work around or fix available if not perhaps they'll at least add the bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release preventive maintenance NUM you wouldn't drive your car NUM miles without giving it a tuneup a computer is no different regular tuneups avoid a lot of problems although there are mac mechanics who'll be happy to charge you NUM or more for the equivalent of an oil change there's no reason you can't change it yourself the following ninestep program should be performed about every three months trash unneeded files NUM many of the operations that follow will run faster and more smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a little time cleaning up your hard disk if you're at all like me you'll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for applications you no longer have archives of software you've dearchived shareware you tried out and didn't like announcements for events that have come and gone and many other files you no longer need if you're running system NUM you may also have several more megabytes in your trash can alone throw them away and empty the trash rethink your extensions NUM some macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain seriously consider whether you actually need every extension in your collection if you don't use the functionality of an extension at least every fifth time you boot up you're probably better off not storing it in your system folder where it only takes up memory destabilizes your system and slows down every startup for instance if you only read pc disks once a month there's no need to keep accesspc loaded all the time cutting back on your extension habit can really help avoid crashes rebuild the desktop NUM the desktop filedatabase holds all the information necessary to associate each file with the application that created it it lets the system know what application should be launched when you open a given file and what icons it should display where depending on its size each application has one or more representatives in the desktop file as applications and files move on and off your hard disk the desktop file can be become bloated and corrupt think of it as a congress for your mac every so often it's necessary to throw the bums out and start with a clean slate fortunately it's easier to rebuild the desktop than to defeat an incumbent one warning rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments you've stored in the get info boxes under system NUM maurice volaski's freeware init commentkeeper will retain those comments across a rebuild commentkeeper also works with system NUM but only if apple's desktop manager extension is also installed to rebuild the desktop restart your mac and as your extensions finish loading depress the command and option keys you'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild the desktop and warning you that this could take a few minutes click ok it will take more than a few minutes the more files you have the longer it will take if you're running system NUM you may want to turn off multifinder before trying to rebuild the desktop if you're experiencing definite problems and not just doing preventive maintenance you may want to use fifth generation's freeware init desktop reset desktop reset completely deletes the desktop file before rebuilding it thus eliminating possibly corrupt data structures zap the pram and reset the clock NUM all macs from the original 128k thin mac to the quadra NUM contain a small amount of battery powered ram to hold certain settings that properly move with the cpu rather than with the disk such as which disk to boot from unfortunately this parameter ram can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes to reset it under system NUM hold down the command option p and r keys while restarting your mac under system NUM hold down the command option and shift keys while selecting the control panel from the apple menu click yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter ram since you've erased almost all the settings in the general control panel you should now reset them to whatever you want the one setting that zapping the pram does not erase is the date and time but since the internal clock in the macintosh is notoriously inaccurate you'll probably want to take this opportunity to reset it anyway resize the system heap NUM even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most people still have at least half a row of icons march across the bottom of their screen every time they restart all these extensions and most applications too need space in a section of memory called the system heap if the system heap isn't big enough to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of it they all start playing king of the mountain on the system heap knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and trying to climb back on after they get knocked off all this fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance and almost inevitably crashes the mac if you're using system NUM your macintosh will automatically resize the system heap as necessary but if you're running system NUM it's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage all your extensions and applications by default this size is set to 128k way too small for most macs with any extensions at all the system heap size is stored in the normally noneditable boot blocks of every system disk bill steinberg's freeware utility bootman not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much needs to be allocated if you're running system NUM get bootman use it and be amazed at how infrequently your macintosh crashes reinstall the system software NUM system files can become corrupt and fragmented especially if you've stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them merely updating the system software will often not fix system file corruption i recommend doing a clean reinstall here's how NUM boot from the installer floppy of your system disks NUM copy any nonstandard fonts and desk accessories out of your system file into a temporary suitcase NUM trash the system file on your hard disk also trash the finder multifinder da handler and all other standard apple extensions like control panel and chooser these will all be replaced in the new installation if you're running or installing system NUM move everything in the extensions control panels and preferences folders into the top level of the system folder NUM rename the system folder any name other than system folder is fine NUM doubleclick the installer script on your system disk then choose customize select the appropriate software for your model mac and printer you could do an easy install instead but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don't need that waste your memory and disk space NUM once installation is finished move everything from the temporary folder you created in step NUM into the new system folder if you're asked if you want to replace anything you forgot to take something out in step NUM you'll need to replace things individually until you find the duplicate piece NUM reinstall any fonts or da's you removed in step NUM NUM reboot you should now have a clean defragmented system file that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable system overall disk utilities NUM much like system files hard disks have data structures that occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even causing data loss apple includes disk first aid a simple utility for detecting and repairing hard disk problems with its system disks it's also available for anonymous ftp from ftpapplecom in the directory dtsmacsyssofthdsc even if you have an earlier version you should get the latest version NUM from ftpapplecom and run it on all your hard disks several companies have released payware disk utilities that detect and repair considerably more problems than disk first aid though interestingly none of them detect and repair everything that disk first aid does the three most effective for general work are central point's mactools deluxe NUM fifth generation's public utilites and symantec's norton utilities for the macintosh NUM a department or work group should have all of these as well as disk first aid since none of them fix everything the others do for individuals mactools NUM street is about half the price of norton NUM street or public utilities NUM street so features and ease of use being roughly equal i recommend mactools all of these products occasionally encounter problems they can't fix when that happens it's time to backup NUM and reformat NUM backing up NUM this is one part of preventative maintenance that should be done a lot more often than every three months the simplest back up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies or other removable media if you keep your data files separate from your application and support files then it's easy to only back up those folders which change frequently nonetheless every three months you should do a complete backup of your hard disk a number of programs are available to make backing up easier apple included a very basic full backup application with system NUM with the performas apple ships a new apple backup utility that can backup the entire disk or just the system folder onto floppies the previously mentioned norton utilities for the mac and mactools deluxe NUM include more powerful floppy backup utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups finally if you're lucky enough to have a tape drive network server or removable media device to use for backups you should check out the more powerful payware utilities redux NUM street doesn't support tape drives and diskfit pro NUM street there are no freely available backup utilities other than the old hd backup from system NUM disk defragmentation NUM as disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free space in the same place to write large files therefore the operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be stored in different places on your hard disk as files become more and more fragmented performance can degrade there are several ways to defragment a hard disk the most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your files erase the hard disk and you might as well reformat while you're at it see question NUM and restore all the files a number of payware utilities including norton utilities for the mac and mac tools deluxe can defragment a disk in place ie without erasing it although the ads for all these products brag about their safety once you've bought the software and opened the shrinkwrap they all warn you to back up your disk before defragmenting it in case something does go wrong there are no freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don't annoy the net by asking for one reformat your hard disk NUM just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use so a hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data you don't need to reformat every three months but when your system is crashing no matter what you try reformatting is the ultimate means of wiping the slate clean reformatting your hard disk may even gain you a few extra megabytes of space not all hard disks are created equal some can hold more data than others to facilitate mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks NUM megabytes is the average formatted capacity your mileage may vary apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator of drive capacity when you reformat there's no reason at all not to reclaim whatever unused space apple's left on your disk unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to initialize them most hard disks come with formatting software apple's disks and system software ship with hd sc setup a minimal disk formatter which will format apple brand hard drives only most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with their hard drives normally this will be all you need to reformat your hard disk a number of generalpurpose formatters are also available which go beyond the bundled software to include features like encryption password protection multiple partitioning faster disk access system NUM compatibility and even compression two of the best are the payware drive7 and hard disk toolkit personal edition NUM street for either while there are one or two freeware formatters available none are likely to be superior to the ones bundled with your hard disk powerbook users should be sure to turn off sleep and processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter what software they use otherwise disk corruption crashes and data losses are a very good possibility elliotte rusty harold department of mathematics elharoshivanjitedu new jersey institute of technology erh0362teslanjitedu newark nj NUM\",\n",
